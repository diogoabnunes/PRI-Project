[{"category":"Circuit","circuitId":1,"name":"Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit","location":"Melbourne","country":"Australia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Melbourne_Grand_Prix_Circuit","circuit_text":["The Albert Park Circuit is a motorsport street circuit around Albert Park Lake, three kilometres south of central Melbourne.","It is used annually as a circuit for the traditional Formula One season-opening Australian Grand Prix, the supporting Supercars Championship Melbourne 400 and other associated support races.","The circuit has an FIA Grade 1 license.","Although the entire track consists of normally public roads, each sector includes medium to high-speed characteristics more commonly associated with dedicated racetracks facilitated by grass and gravel run-off safety zones that are reconstructed annually.","However, the circuit also has characteristics of a street circuit's enclosed nature due to concrete barriers annually built along the Lakeside Drive curve, in particular, where run-off is not available due to the proximity of the lake shore.","The circuit uses everyday sections of road that circle Albert Park Lake, a small man-altered lake (originally a large lagoon formed as part of the ancient Yarra River course) just south of the Central Business District of Melbourne.","The road sections that are used were rebuilt before the inaugural event in 1996 to ensure consistency and smoothness.","As a result, compared to other circuits that are held on public roads, the Albert Park track has quite a smooth surface.","Before 2007 there existed only a few other places on the Formula 1 calendar with a body of water close to the track.","Many of the new tracks, such as Valencia, Singapore and Abu Dhabi are close to a body of water.","The course is considered to be quite fast and relatively easy to drive, drivers having commented that the consistent placement of corners allows them to easily learn the circuit and achieve competitive times.","However, the flat terrain around the lake, coupled with a track design that features few true straights, means that the track is not conducive to overtaking or easy spectating unless in possession of a grandstand seat.","Each year, most of the trackside fencing, pedestrian overpasses, grandstands, and other motorsport infrastructure are erected approximately two months before the Grand Prix weekend and removed within 6 weeks after the event.","The land around the circuit (including a large aquatic centre, a golf course, a Lakeside Stadium, some restaurants, and rowing boathouses) has restricted access during that entire period.","Dissent is still prevalent among nearby residents and users of those other facilities, and some still maintain a silent protest against the event.","Nevertheless, the event is reasonably popular in Melbourne and Australia (with a large European population and a general interest in motorsport).","Middle Park, the home of South Melbourne FC was demolished in 1994 due to expansion at Albert Park.","On 4 July 2008, F1 announced that more than 300,000 people attended the four-day Melbourne Grand Prix, though actual ticket sales were later disputed by the local media.","There has never been a night race at Albert Park, although the 2009 and 2010 events both started at 5:00p.m.","local time.","The current contract for the Grand Prix at the circuit concludes in 2025.","Following the postponement of the Australian Grand Prix in 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the track underwent layout changes, the most notable part is the modification of the Turn 9-10 complex from a heavy right-left corner to a fast-sweeping right-left corner into Turns 11 and 12.","Further modifications include the widening of the pit lane by 2 metres and the reprofiling of Turn 13.","Also, some corners will be widened such as Turn 1, Turn 3, Turn 6, Turn 7, and Turn 15; and it is expected that these modifications will reduce qualifying lap times by as much as 5 seconds.","Starting on the Walker Straight, Turn 1 is a tight right-hander, followed by a quick flick to the left in Turn 2.","A short straight follows, in which the cars accelerate up to 300km\/h, before Turn 3 is taken at a third of that speed.","Two successive short straights lead to the left and right-handers of Turns 4 and 5, and the end of Sector 1.","The next straight lasts for half a kilometre, before a 90-degree right in Turn 6.","Turn 7, a small leftwards kink, leads onto a sweeping right-hander.","Turns 9 and 10, a car park when not in use, form the Clark Chicane, before the long lakeside sweep right up to Turn 11, on which the cars reach 300km\/h.","The next two corners are the fastest on the circuit, with drivers taking this chicane at up to 225km\/h, sustaining g-forces up to 3.5g.","The straight that follows, with a small right kink in the middle, is a DRS zone (the detection point was shortly before Turn 11), before another 90-degree right in the form of Turn 13, called Ascari.","After another short straight, the right-hander of Turn 14 leads to the slowest corner on the track, a tight left.","The pit lane entry is located halfway between this corner and the next, a faster right-hander, which together form an extended chicane, and lead back onto the Walker Straight.","The track is known for being bumpy, and in even slightly wet weather, is notoriously slippery.","During the nine months of the year when the track is not required for Grand Prix preparation or the race weekend, most of the track can be driven by ordinary street-registered vehicles either clockwise or anti-clockwise.","Only the sections between turns 3, 4, and 5, then 5 and 6, differ significantly from the race track configuration.","Turn 4 is replaced by a car park access road running directly from turns 3 to 5.","Between turns 5 and 6, the road is blocked.","It is possible to drive from turn 5 on to Albert Road and back on to the track at turn 7 though three sets of lights control the flow of this option.","The only set of lights on the actual track is halfway between turns 12 and 13, where drivers using Queens Road are catered for.","The chicanes at turns 11 and 12 are considerably more open than that used in the Grand Prix, using the escape roads.","Turn 9 is also a car park and traffic is directed down another escape road.","The speed limit is generally 40 kilometres per hour (25mph), while some short sections have a speed limit of 50 kilometres per hour (31mph), which is still slower than an F1 car under pit lane speed restrictions.","The back of the track, turns 7 to 13 inclusive, is known as Lakeside Drive.","Double lines separate the two-way traffic along most of Lakeside Drive with short road islands approximately every 50 metres which means overtaking is illegal here.","Black Swans live and breed in Albert Park, and frequently cross the road causing traffic delays, sometimes with up to five cygnets (young swans).","Approximately 80% of the track edge is lined with short parkland-style chain-linked fencing leaving normal drivers less room for error than F1 drivers have during race weekend.","There is however substantial shoulder room between the outside of each lane and the fencing, which is used as parking along Aughtie Drive during the other nine months.","Prior to World War 2, attempts were made to use Albert Park for motor racing.","The first was in 1934 but failed due to opposition, and a second attempt for a motorcycle race in 1937 similarly failed.","Finally in 1953 the Light Car Club of Australia were able to secure use of the circuit for that year's Australian Grand Prix.","Albert Park is the only venue to host the Australian Grand Prix in both World Championship and non-World Championship formats with an earlier configuration of the current circuit used for the race on two occasions during the 1950s.","During this time racing was conducted in an anti-clockwise direction as opposed to the current circuit which runs clockwise.","1958 was the final year of the original incarnation of the circuit, with racing ending due to a negative campaign lead by the press."]},{"category":"Circuit","circuitId":2,"name":"Sepang International Circuit","location":"Kuala Lumpur","country":"Malaysia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sepang_International_Circuit","circuit_text":["The Sepang International Circuit (Malay: Litar Antarabangsa Sepang) is a motorsport race track in Sepang, Selangor, Malaysia.","It is located approximately 45km (28mi) south of Kuala Lumpur, and close to Kuala Lumpur International Airport.","It hosted the Formula One Malaysian Grand Prix between 1999 and 2017, and is also the venue for the Malaysian Motorcycle Grand Prix, the Malaysia Merdeka Endurance Race and other major motorsport events.","The circuit was designed by German designer Hermann Tilke, who would subsequently design circuits including in Shanghai, Sakhir, Istanbul, Marina Bay and Yas Marina.","As part of a series of major infrastructure projects in the 1990s under Mahathir Mohamad's government, the Sepang International Circuit was constructed between 1997 and 1999 close to Putrajaya, the then-newly founded administrative capital of the country, with the intent of hosting the Malaysian Grand Prix.","Similar to other of the country's circuits, the circuit is known for its unpredictable humid tropical weather, varying from clear furnace hot days to tropical rain storms.","The circuit was officially inaugurated by the 4th Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad on 7 March 1999 at 20:30 MST (UTC+08:00).","He subsequently went on to inaugurate the first Moto GP Malaysian Grand Prix on 20 April 1999 (see 1999 Malaysian motorcycle Grand Prix) and the first Formula One Petronas Malaysian Grand Prix on 17 October 1999 (see 1999 Malaysian Grand Prix).","On 23 October 2011, on the second lap of the MotoGP Shell Advance Malaysian Grand Prix, the Italian motorcycle racer Marco Simoncelli died following a crash in turn 11 on Lap 2, resulting in an abandonment of the race.","The track was completely resurfaced in 2016, with several corners reprofiled to emphasize mechanical, rather than aerodynamic grip.","Notably, the final corner was raised by approximately 1 meter, which officials claimed would force drivers to take a later apex and explore different racing lines through the hairpin.","In October 2016 it was rumored that the Sepang circuit may be dropped from the Formula One calendar due to dwindling ticket sales, and held its nineteenth and last World Championship Grand Prix in 2017.","The race's contract was due to expire in 2018, but its future had been under threat due to rising hosting fees and declining ticket sales.","The main circuit, normally raced in a clockwise direction, is 5.543km (3.444mi) long, and is noted for its sweeping corners and wide straights.","The layout is quite unusual, with a 927m (1,014yd) long back straight separated from the pit straight by just one very tight hairpin.","Other configurations of the Sepang circuit can also be used.","The north circuit is also raced in a clockwise direction.","It is basically the first half of the main circuit.","The course turns back towards the pit straight after turn 6 and is 2.706km (1.681mi) long in total.","The south circuit is the other half of the racecourse.","The back straight of the main circuit becomes the pit straight when the south circuit is in use, and joins onto turn 8 of the main circuit to form a hairpin turn.","Also run clockwise, this circuit is 2.609km (1.621mi) in length.","Sepang International Circuit also features kart racing and motocross facilities.","Sepang starts with a long pit straight where the DRS zone exists \u2013 crucial for drivers to get a good exit out of the last corner to gain as much speed as possible.","Turn 1 is a very long, slow corner taken in second gear.","Most drivers brake incredibly late and lose speed gradually as they file round the corner, similar to Shanghai's first turn but slower.","Turn 1 leads straight into Turn 2, a tight left hairpin which goes downhill quite significantly.","The first two corners are quite bumpy, making it hard to put power onto the track.","Turn 3 is a long flat out right hander which leads into Turn 4 \u2013 known locally as the Langkawi Curve \u2013 a second gear, right-angle right-hander.","Turns 5 and 6 make up an incredibly high-speed, long chicane that hurts tyres and puts a lot of stress on drivers due to high G-Force.","It is locally known as the Genting Curve.","Turns 7 and 8 (the KLIA curve) make up a long, medium-speed, double-apex right hander, and a bump can cause the car to lose balance here.","Turn 9 is a very slow left-hand hairpin (the Berjaya Tioman Corner), similar to turn two but uphill.","Turn 10 leads into a challenging, medium-speed right hander at turn 11, requiring braking and turning simultaneously.","Turn 12 is a flat-out, bumpy left which immediately leads into the flat right at turn 13, then the challenging 'Sunway Lagoon' curve at turn 14.","Similar to turn 11, it requires hard-braking and steering at the same time.","It is taken in second gear.","The long back straight can be a good place for drivers to overtake as they brake hard into turn 15, a left-handed, second-geared hairpin but drivers are advised by experts to be careful not to get re-overtaken as they come into turn 1."]},{"category":"Circuit","circuitId":3,"name":"Bahrain International

Series (now FIA Formula 2), and the annual  Formula One Bahrain Grand Prix.","The 2004 Grand Prix was the first held in the Middle East.","Beginning in 2006, Australian V8 Supercars raced at the BIC, with the event known as the Desert 400.","However, the V8 Supercars did not return for the 2011 V8 Supercar season.","24 Hour endurance races are also hosted at BIC.","The circuit has a FIA Grade 1 license.","The circuit also has multiple layouts.","The construction of the Bahrain circuit was a national objective for Bahrain, initiated by the Crown Prince, Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa.","The Crown Prince is the Honorary President of the Bahrain Motor Federation.","TRL was asked to build the circuit, headed by Patrick Brogan.","Race organizers were worried that the circuit would not be complete in time for the 2004 Bahrain Grand Prix and attempted to cancel the event; however, Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone refused this request.","In the end, the circuit was not quite fully complete, but was good enough for the grand prix to go ahead.","After the 2004 race and ahead of the 2005 race the track was realigned at turn four, decreasing the circuit's overall length by 5 metres.","In 2007 the circuit became the first Grand Prix circuit to be awarded the distinguished FIA Institute Centre of Excellence award, given for excellent safety, race marshal, and medical facilities, and for the high standards of technology required to maintain these.","At the 2009 Grand Prix, BIC announced a collaboration with @bahrain to develop land next to the circuit.","@bahrain is part of the Mumtalakat group of companies.","@bahrain will dedicate more than 1million square meters of business, entertainment and educational space with a value in excess of US$2bn (BHD 850million), making it one of the largest investment projects to take place in Bahrain in the past five years.","In 2011 the circuit was scheduled to be the first GP of the season.","However, due to civil unrest in the country the race had to be cancelled in March 2011.","On 4 June the FIA announced that the race would be scheduled for 30 October, the original slot for the inaugural Indian Grand Prix, which would be shifted to a season-closing date on 11 December.","However, two days later following concerns from teams and other officials, the race organizers officially cancelled the race, choosing to focus their attention on the 2012 running.","The 2012 Formula One calendar had the race scheduled for 22 April, the fourth of the season.","The circuit was designed by German architect Hermann Tilke, the same architect who designed the Sepang International Circuit in Malaysia.","The main contractor for the project was Cebarco-WCT.","The circuit cost approximately 56.2 million Bahraini Dinars (US$150million) to construct.","It has six separate tracks, including a test oval and a drag strip.","The circuit posed a unique problem.","Positioned in the middle of a desert, there were worries that sand would blow onto the circuit and disrupt the race.","However, organizers were able to keep the sand off the track by spraying an adhesive on the sand around the track.","The surface of the track is made of graywacke aggregate, shipped to Bahrain from Bayston Hill quarry in Shropshire, England.","The surface material is highly acclaimed by circuit bosses and Formula 1 drivers for the high level of grip it offers.","The same aggregate material is used at the Yas Marina Circuit, venue of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.","Shortly after the Formula One February 2014 testing, the first corner of the track was renamed after seven-time champion German driver Michael Schumacher in honour of his achievements and also in support after he suffered an almost fatal skiing accident late December 2013.","The DRS zone is on the pit straight at the Bahrain Grand Prix (starting 2012), so turn 1 (\"Michael Schumacher turn\") is the prime overtaking opportunity.","The corner itself is incredibly tight; a typical F1 car must brake approximately 100 metres before the corner and shift right down to gear one.","The width of the track further adds to the overtaking possibilities.Turns 2 and 3 are flat out and gaining a good exit can set up an overtaking opportunity into turn 4.","The straight leading to turn 4 is very long with a DRS zone, and the track at the corner itself is incredibly wide, at about thirty metres.","Turns 5, 6 and 7 make up a high-speed left-right-left \"S\" section that leads into turn 8, a right-hand hairpin where taking a wide line can avoid the bump on the apex which unsettles the car.","Turns 9 and 10 are very challenging as they are two blind left-handers where cars must brake, downshift and turn simultaneously \u2013 they go from 205km\/h in gear 5 down to 63km\/h in gear 1 whilst trying to avoid locking up their inside front tyres.","The back straight leads down into turns 11, 12 and 13, a medium-speed complex of corners.","Turn 11 is a fourth-gear left hander that leads immediately into the flat-out right hander of 12, then the third gear right-hander of turn 13 which requires a good exit to gain speed down the following straight.","It is worth braking quite early for turn 14 to gain speed down the main straight.","If you brake about 100 metres before the apex then it is easy to keep it tidy through the slow right hander and you can also put the power down early, and gain speed all the way through turn 15 and the main straight (which is the DRS zone).","The lap record (which only accounts for laps set in a race) on the current layout of the Grand Prix circuit was set in 2005 by Pedro de la Rosa at 1:31.447, in what was the only fastest lap in his 104-race career.","Michael Schumacher set a faster time of 1:30.252 at the 2004 edition of the race, but alterations to turn 4 of the track meant that it was counted as a different layout from 2005 onwards.","The fastest time ever set at the track was produced by Lewis Hamilton during qualifying for the 2020 edition at 1:27.264, beating the previous record by Charles Leclerc, set during qualifying for the 2019 edition (1:27.866).","The Bahrain International Circuit hosts a number of high-profile series, including the FIA Formula One World Championship, the FIA World Endurance Championship, the FIA Formula 2 Championship, Chevrolet Lumina Series, Thunder Arabia and Radical.","Also every year there is the traditional 24 Hours of Bahrain.","In the past the circuit has hosted the FIA GT Championship, Speedcar Series, Australian V8 Supercars, GP2 Asia Series, and a one-off Bahrain Superprix involving Formula Three cars, following on from the collapsed Korea Super Prix.","The first ever Formula BMW World Final took place in Bahrain.","The first Bahrain Grand Prix took place on 4 April 2004, making history as the first Formula One Grand Prix to be held in the Middle East.","Bahrain fought off fierce competition from elsewhere in the region to stage the race, with Egypt, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) all hoping for the prestige of hosting a Formula One Grand Prix (the UAE would host a Grand Prix from 2009).","The Bahrain Grand Prix is usually the third race on the Formula One calendar, apart from the 2006 season, when Bahrain swapped places with the traditional opener, the Australian Grand Prix, which was pushed back to avoid a clash with the Commonwealth Games.","In 2009, Bahrain was moved to the fourth race.","For the 2010 season Bahrain was again the season opener and Formula One cars drove the full 6.299km (3.914mi) \"Endurance Circuit\" to celebrate F1's 'diamond jubilee'.","For 2011 however F1 was set to return to racing on the original layout used between 2004 and 2009.","The race was postponed and finally cancelled due to protests in the country but F1 returned to the track for the 2012 Bahrain Grand Prix.","2014 saw the track host its first ever Grand Prix under lights, as the race was scheduled as a night race to celebrate the tenth year of Formula 1 at the circuit.","Subsequent editions of the race have also been held at night.","In 2020 the circuit hosted two Grands Prix, the Bahrain and Sakhir Grands Prix, after the calendar was revised following the COVID-19 pandemic with the second using an alternative layout."]},{"category":"Circuit","circuitId":4,"name":"Circuit de

Spain.","With long straights and a variety of corners, the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya is seen as an all-rounder circuit.","The track has stands with a capacity of 140,700.","The circuit has FIA Grade 1 license.","Until 2013 the track was known only as the Circuit de Catalunya, before a sponsorship deal with Barcelona City Council added Barcelona to the track's title.","The Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya was built in 1991 and began hosting the Spanish Grand Prix that same year.","Construction also coincided with the Olympic Games scheduled to take place in Barcelona the next year, where the circuit acted as the start and finish line for the road team time trial cycling event.","The Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya should not be confused with the Montju\u00efc circuit, which hosted the Spanish Grand Prix four times between 1969 and 1975 and, unlike the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, is actually located within the city of Barcelona.","Because so much testing is done at this circuit, Formula One drivers and mechanics are extremely familiar with it.","This has led to criticism that drivers and mechanics are too familiar with Catalunya, reducing the amount of on-track action.","When first used, overtaking was frequent as cars could follow closely through the last two corners and slipstream down the long straight.","As aerodynamic balance became more critical, this overtaking method drastically decreased as the cars were unable to follow each other through the fast final corner due to turbulence created by the leading car.","The 2007 season saw the first of the two final sweepers replaced with a slow chicane in an effort to improve overtaking.","The chicane has been criticised for failing at this goal and causing congestion during qualifying sessions.","The chicane reduces speeds through the final corner, where serious accidents could occur.","The Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya has hosted a motorcycle Grand Prix since 1992, originally the European motorcycle Grand Prix from 1992 and later the Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix since 1996.","There are at least five points on the track (turns 1, 2, 4, 10, 14) where riders are known to overtake.","As in Formula 1, Turn 1 is arguably the most popular place for overtaking.","The circuit is not known to produce copious amounts of overtaking, despite the long straights.","Originally, the Formula 1 circuit changes were not instituted for MotoGP; however, after a fatal crash in the 2016 MotoGP round involving a Moto2 rider, Luis Salom, the Formula 1 layout was implemented to slow down riders for safety purposes.","The FIM made a further change to the chicane for 2017 by moving up the chicane to prevent riders from cutting the pit lane entrance, but that was abandoned because the motorcycle chicane had a surface change that created more safety issues with the transition.","Further changes were made to the circuit in December 2017 as grandstands were removed to add additional runoff that allowed the FIM to eliminate that chicane (although the Turn 10 hairpin was kept).","The track was resurfaced in 2018 as a result of calls by MotoGP riders to improve the amount of grip on the surface.","Previously the track had been resurfaced in 2004.","The circuit hosted many other international racing series, including the FIA Sportscar Championship (1999\u20132002), European Touring Car Championship (2003), FIA GT Championship (2003), Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (2006\u20132011), European Le Mans Series (2008\u20132009, 2019, 2021-present), and World Series by Renault (2002\u20132004, 2006\u20132011), GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup (2017-present), 24h de Barcelona Trofeu Ferm\u00ed V\u00e9lez.","FIA World Rallycross Championship currently visits Catalunya since 2015.","Since 2016, the racetrack hosts the 24h BiCircuit Festival, an ultra-distance cycling event featuring 24-hour, 12-hour and 6-hour races for soloists and relay teams up to 8 riders.","For the 2020 Formula One season Liberty Media expected the calendar would consist of twenty-one Grands Prix and that any new races would come at the expense of existing events, in particular the Dutch Grand Prix in Zandvoort replacing the Spanish Grand Prix on Circuit de Barcelona, but later negotiated an agreement with the teams to allow up to twenty-two Grands Prix, salvaging the Spanish Grand Prix.","Barcelona has the 3-star FIA Environmental Accreditation and the ISO 14001 certification.","In a 2021 report, it was ranked the second most sustainable racetrack in the world, together with Circuit Paul Ricard and behind Mugello Circuit.","The track is demanding of a car's aerodynamic qualities.","The wind direction at the circuit can change drastically during the day, a significant factor given the importance of aerodynamics to modern Formula One cars.","It is then hard to find a good setup since cars can have massive aerodynamic drag and understeer on one part of the circuit in the morning, but suffer oversteer at the same part of the circuit in the afternoon.","A given tyre compound can work well when tested, but not so well a couple of months later.","These changeable conditions can make for unexpected performances from some teams during the race.","The changeable wind conditions have also caused accidents at the circuit, with Fernando Alonso's testing accident in 2015 partly blamed on the severity of the wind.","Through 2015, the MotoGP layout used the 1995-2003 version of the Grand Prix circuit.","This was originally the same layout as Formula One, but in 2004 a new, slower La Caixa turn was built;  the motorcycles continued to use the old version, and they also ignored the shorter Europcar turn and RACC chicane.","The F1 layout was implemented for MotoGP originally in 2016 following the fatal accident of Luis Salom in Europcar corner on 3 June 2016.","Race control switched to the F1 circuit for qualifying and the race on 5 June 2016.","On 15 December 2016, the FIM announced the change was permanent by announcing plans for a chicane ahead of the current car chicane.","However, during the 2017 race, the new chicane was deemed dangerous by riders because of a surface change, and the car chicane was used during that event.","After changes to the track in the off-season including removing grandstands in Turn 12, creating additional runoff and a complete repaving of the circuit, the F1 layout from 2004-06, including the new La Caixa hairpin instead of the long sweeper, was used, eliminating the chicane.","For 2021, the La Caixa hairpin was remodelled again, slower than the original one but faster than the F1 one.","The alterations were done to improve safety for the drivers.","The World RX of Spain uses parts of the track near turns 11\u201315, with two additional gravel sections.","Turn 1 is the main overtaking point at Catalunya, as it is a braking zone at the end of a long DRS straight.","The inside and outside are equally difficult for overtaking; drivers who can hold the line around the outside of turn one, can get the inside line for turn two.","The corners themselves make up a medium-speed chicane\u2013 drivers brake rather late for turn one (Elf) and shift down to gear two, and turn two is almost full throttle as they try to gain as much exit speed as possible.","Turn 3 (Renault) is a long, flat-out (in most cars) right-hander that has a g-force of about four, and it leads to a short straight before turn 4, the Repsol curve.","Another right-hander, turn four is similar to Monza's Curva Parabolica\u2013 drivers brake and take an early apex (in third gear), carrying great speed out of the exit.","Turn 5 (Seat) comes immediately after and is a slow left-hander taken in second gear which drops rapidly downhill towards the left kink of turn 6 which is ignored by F1 cars.","Turns 7 and 8 make up a medium-speed, uphill, left-right chicane.","Drivers brake and shift down to gear three, and must not run too wide as turn eight has a large kerb on its apex which could potentially damage cars' suspensions.","Turn 9, Campsa Corner, is a very fast, sixth-gear right-hander which is made incredibly difficult by being completely blind (drivers cannot see the apex on approach).","It is initially quite steep uphill but the exit is then downhill, so it is quite easy to run wide onto the astroturf.","The long back straight leads into turn 10 (La Caixa), a second-gear, left-hand corner, then turns 11 and 12, a left kink before a long, slow, third-gear right.","The next section has been redesigned by German engineer Hermann Tilke to lower speeds onto the 1,047m (1,145yd) pit straight\u2013 which in turn increases overtaking opportunities and safety.","Turn 13 is a tight, third-gear right-hander and drivers have to cross the track quickly to take the racing line through the slow left-right chicane of turns 14 and 15, taken in second gear.","Good traction is needed here as it determines speed down the pit straight.","Turn 16 (New Holland) is a flat-out right-hander which takes cars across the start\/finish line.","The circuit has been the site of some memorable moments.","In 1991, Ayrton Senna and Nigel Mansell went down the entire front straight side-by-side while dueling for second place, with Mansell eventually taking the position and ultimately the race itself.","In 1994, Michael Schumacher managed to finish in second place despite driving over half the race with only fifth gear.","In 1996, Schumacher took his first win as a Ferrari driver, after a dominant performance during a torrential rainstorm.","In 2001, Mika H\u00e4kkinen suffered a clutch failure while leading the race on the last lap, handing the win to Schumacher.","At the 2006 event, Fernando Alonso became the first Spanish Formula One driver to win at his home country's track.","In 2008, Heikki Kovalainen left the track at 240km\/h (149mph) after a wheel rim failure at turn 9.","He managed to decelerate to 130km\/h (81mph) when he hit the tyre barrier.","He was temporarily unconscious and suffered a minor concussion, but a few minutes later, spectators were relieved when he gave a thumbs up.","The circuit has been the scene of two debut wins in Formula One.","Pastor Maldonado took his first and only Grand Prix victory here in 2012, and in 2016 Max Verstappen won his first Grand Prix.","As a result, he became the youngest driver to ever win an F1 Grand Prix race.","At the 2009 motorcycle Grand Prix, teammates Valentino Rossi and Jorge Lorenzo fought all race long for first place, culminating in an overtake on the final corner by Rossi.","Riders and pundits described the race as \"historic\" and \"genius\".","On 3 June 2016, during Moto2 Free Practice for the 2016 Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, Luis Salom crashed in turn 12, resulting in the session being red-flagged.","After being transferred to the local Hospital General de Catalunya, Salom died of the injuries sustained in the crash.","Upon hearing this, FIM decided to change the current layout of the track to the same layout as the one used in Formula One.","After off-season discussions, the FIM announced that the track layout would be slightly modified in that the chicane would be moved up a few metres.","The public attendance at the Spanish Grand Prix, and at the Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, have fallen significantly since 2007, which has complicated the economic solvency of this circuit.","At least since 2009, the circuit is economically deficient, and in the period 2009\u20132018, \u20ac50.5m of losses were generated.","The economic survival of the Circuit is only guaranteed by large volumes of public money, which both the Provincial Deputation of Barcelona  and the Generalitat de Catalunya provide in the form of grants and rinsing of losses.","Given these poor results, even some senior officials of the Generalitat de Catalunya have sometimes considered eliminating Formula One in this Circuit.","Due to the irregularities detected in the last audit, the City Council of Barcelona decided to cancel the economic grant that the circuit received until now, which has aggravated its economy.","Recently, some more irregularities have been detected, even by the Generalitat de Catalunya.","The Circuit is located in an elevated area with respect to its environment, and without protective measures to minimize the noise pollution  produced by cars, motorbikes and other vehicles.","Therefore, it is an important source of acoustic disturbances, because the noise produced during many days during the year is noticeable in many kilometers around, especially in the adjacent municipalities, which is recognized by the Generalitat itself, the main owner of the

Istanbul Park (Turkish: \u0130stanbul Park), also known as the Istanbul Racing Circuit or initially as the Istanbul Otodrom, is a motor sports race track in the Tuzla district of Istanbul, Turkey.","It was designed by the well-known racetrack architect Hermann Tilke and was inaugurated on 21 August 2005.","It has been called \"the best race track in the world\" by former Formula One Chief Executive Bernie Ecclestone, who held the managing rights of the circuit between 2007 and 2011.","The circuit has been currently managed by the Turkish company Intercity since 2012.","The venue of the Turkish Grand Prix is located in the crossing of boundaries of Pendik and Tuzla districts on the Asian side of Istanbul, close to the junction of Kurtk\u00f6y on the north side of the O\u20134 motorway, linking Istanbul to Ankara.","It is near Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en International Airport and is surrounded by forests and fields.","The Istanbul Park racing circuit was one of only five circuits running anticlockwise in the 2011 Formula One season, the others being Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace (used for the Brazilian Grand Prix), the Marina Bay Street Circuit (used for the Singapore Grand Prix), the Korea International Circuit (used for the Korean Grand Prix) and the Yas Marina Circuit (used for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix).","This unusual anti-clockwise layout leads to increased strain on the other side of the driver's neck than they would experience at most other circuits, especially through the long high-speed left-hander at turn 8.","The circuit is 5.338km (3.317mi) long, with an average width of 15m (49ft) ranging from 14 to 21.5m (46 to 71ft), and covers over 2.215million square metres (547 acres).","With a total of 14 corners, the sharpest with a radius of merely 15m (49ft), the circuit runs over four different ground levels with a start\/finish straight over 650m (2,133ft) in length.","The track has capacity for approximately 125,000 spectators.","The main grandstand has a seating capacity of 25,000 spectators, with natural ground stands and temporary stands allowing for around 100,000 more people.","The paddock buildings are two-level structures; the ground floor reserved for racing teams, the upper floor serving as hospitality areas, with an additional viewing capacity of 5,000 seats.","At each end of the paddock, there are two 7-story VIP towers.","Turn 8 (nicknamed \"Diabolica\" by some in reference to Monza's Curva Parabolica) particularly caught the imagination.","The corner is a fast, sweeping corner with four apexes, similar to one of the multi-apex sections of the old N\u00fcrburgring.","Spectators and drivers alike raved about Turn 8, comparing it to legendary corners such as Eau Rouge and 130R.","The corner eventually became the basis of some of Tilke's newer track turns, such as turns 17 and 18 at the Circuit of the Americas, turn 3 at the Sochi Autodrom, and Buddh International Circuit's turns 10 to 11.","The high loads exerted through this corner contribute to the circuit's reputation for rapid tyre wear.","Another notable corner is Turn 1, a sharp downhill left-hander immediately after the front straight.","This corner has been nicknamed by some as the \"Turkish Corkscrew\" in reference to the famous Corkscrew at WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca.","Both the 2006 F1 and MotoGP races at the circuit featured multiple incidents at this corner.","A third noteworthy area is the uphill kink in the middle of the back straight; due to its similarity to Eau Rouge, it has been jokingly referred to as \"Faux Rouge\".","The circuit is not, however, without its critics.","After qualifying, Jenson Button claimed that the track was getting bumpier as the weekend went on, particularly at Turn 8, which was what caused so many drivers to spin off.","This harks back to another circuit designed by Hermann Tilke, Shanghai International Circuit, which is said to be sinking in places because it was built on the site of a former swamp.","Jarno Trulli was notable for his lukewarm feeling towards the circuit, saying that he felt the circuit was easy to learn, and that good performance was down more to the car than the driver.","The first Grand Prix of Turkey took place in 2005.","Due to financial disagreement, the last Turkish Grand Prix took place in 2011, despite earlier reports that the event would take place until at least 2021.","The top speed measured of an F1 car by the speed trap was 329.5km\/h (204.7mph) in 2005.","F1 cars equipped with the smaller 2.4-litre V8 engines (instead of the 3.0-litre V10s of previous years) reached 320km\/h (200mph) in 2006.","Felipe Massa has an affinity with this circuit, with the Brazilian winning three of the nine Grands Prix held at Istanbul Park with Lewis Hamilton winning two and Sebastian Vettel, Jenson Button, Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Valtteri Bottas having won one race apiece.","Istanbul Park returned for the 2020 Formula One World Championship, after a nine-year absence.","Istanbul Park was due to replace the cancelled Canadian Grand Prix for the 2021 Formula One World Championship.","It would be postponed indefinitely due to Covid-19 travel restrictions imposed on the country by the UK government and would be replaced by the Styrian Grand Prix.","It was later re-added to the calendar in place of the cancelled Singapore Grand Prix.","In 2006, the winner of the GP2 race was Nelson Piquet, Jr., however the real battle was with Lewis Hamilton who, at the beginning of the race, spun off and dropped right down the field from 2nd to 16th.","However he raced his way back through the pack with some spectacular overtaking moves to finish in second.","Fifteen racers completed the race in 2009 while eleven drivers were not classified.","The winner was Russian Vitaly Petrov of Barwa Addax, who moved up to second place in the championship table with 29 points ahead of J\u00e9r\u00f4me d'Ambrosio having 18 points.","Petrov's teammate Romain Grosjean, who retired from the race, leading the championship with 31 points.","The Italians Luca Filippi of Super Nova Racing and Davide Valsecchi of Durango finished second and third.","MotoGP raced at Istanbul Park for three years between 2005 and 2007.","Marco Melandri won the races in 2005 and 2006 with the 2007 race being won by Casey

Monaco","location":"Monte-Carlo","country":"Monaco","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Circuit_de_Monaco","circuit_text":["Circuit de Monaco is a street circuit laid out on the city streets of Monte Carlo and La Condamine around the harbour of the Principality of Monaco.","It is commonly, and even officially, referred to as \"Monte Carlo\" because it is largely inside the Monte Carlo neighbourhood of Monaco.","The circuit is annually used on two weekends in May for Formula One Monaco Grand Prix and Formula E Monaco ePrix (odd years) or Historic Grand Prix of Monaco (even years).","Formula One's respective feeder series over the years\u2013 Formula 3000, GP2 Series and today the Formula 2 championship\u2013 also visit the circuit concurrently with Formula One.","The Monaco Grand Prix is one of the three events where victory counts towards the Triple Crown of Motorsport.","The idea for a Grand Prix race around the streets of Monaco came from Antony Nogh\u00e8s, the president of the Monegasque motor club, Automobile Club de Monaco, and close friend of the ruling Grimaldi family.","The inaugural race was held in 1929 and was won by William Grover-Williams in a Bugatti.","To date, only three local drivers have won a race at the Circuit.","Louis Chiron did it at the non-championship 1931 Monaco Grand Prix; 82 years later, Stefano Coletti crossed the line in first position at the sprint race of the 2013 Monaco GP2 Series round.","The third driver to do so was St\u00e9phane Richelmi at the sprint race of the 2014 Monaco GP2 Series round.","The track has remained substantially unchanged since its creation in 1929: as a city circuit, its conformation is closely linked to that of the Principality's road system.","The changes were almost entirely connected to redefinitions of the ordinary roads of the town.","In the first editions of the Grand Prix, the start and finish were placed on Boulevard Albert 1er (the innermost straight, which leads to the Sainte D\u00e9vote curve).","In 1955 the start and finish were moved to the opposite straight, overlooking the promenade (that now houses the pit lane).","At the time, neither the Piscine complex nor the \"La Rascasse\" hairpin existed: after the \"Tabac\" curve, the route proceeded in the lane that is parallel to today's starting straight: the two sections (separated only by a row of trees) were joined by a single narrow hairpin called the \"Gasometer\".","It should be noted, as can be seen from the period films, that in the second half of the 1950s the only existing lane after the Tabac was the one mentioned; in fact, in those years, the lane that we now call \"promenade\" with the two \"Piscine\" chicanes was not yet defined, and only in the 1960s images we can notice the progress of the landfilling about that portion of the bay, including the Piscine area which will be completed shortly thereafter.","In 1963 the starting line was again moved to Boulevard Albert 1er (opposite the promenade), without changes to the track from the \"Tabac\" to the \"Gasometer\" (incidentally, the swimming pool and the waterfront lane that 10 years later will become part of the circuit, had already been created).","In 1972 the boxes were moved near the chicane area of the port, therefore was created a \"new\" chicane that was closer to the \"Tabac\" curve.","After this chicane, the track continued on the usual straight (parallel to the starting lane) using the \"Gasometer\" curve for the last time.","This solution lasted only a year and, in the following months, the main works were completed in time for the 1973 Grand Prix with the construction of a new section that still connects the \"Tabac\" curve to \"Piscine\" (Stade Nautique).","This change will result in the addition of 133 metres to the circuit\u2013 whose total length increased to 3,278 metres\u2013 adding the new portion along the harbour, which followed the layout of the swimming pool and ended in a new chicane around the \"La Rascasse\" restaurant and then joined (with a slight climb to the Anthony Noghes curve) to the starting straight.","The boxes were reinstalled in the old lane (now free).","The layout took on its current appearance with the double chicane \"Piscine\", abandoning (by the 1973 GP) the old \"Gasometer\" curve (where the entrance to the new boxes was created).","1972 was also the last year for the passage under the old tunnel.","In 1973, as anticipated, the track was modified at various points also due to the construction of new civil buildings.","In particular, a new hotel was under construction in the \"Old Station\" hairpin area (Hotel Loews, later renamed Fairmont), resulting in an extension of the tunnel towards the \"Portier\" curve.","The 1973 images show the unusual passage under the new long tunnel, above which the pillars of the Loews hotel are being built.","At the exit of the tunnel there was the traditional port chicane and, after the \"Tabac\" curve, the new path adjacent to the swimming pools (two \"S\" left\u2013right and right\u2013left connected by a short straight) and \"La Rascasse\" hairpin.","It was the first year for the new garages in an independent lane, with an entrance just after \"La Rascasse\", where an asphalt slide was installed to overcome the difference in level from the roadway.","In 1976 the \"Sainte D\u00e9vote\" and \"Anthony Noghes\" corners were modified: in order to slow down the transit of the cars, curbs and protections were repositioned.","In 1986, thanks to the expansion of the roadway implemented in the chicane area of the port, the chicane itself was modified and made slower: instead of the previously existing fast change of direction, deemed too dangerous, new curbs were installed to design a double turn at 90 degrees.","It was then renamed \"Nouvelle Chicane\".","In 1997 the first \"Piscine\" corner was modified: the shifting of the track edge protections improved the visibility for the pilots and allowed a higher speed.","A year later (at the request of Pasquale Lattuneddu, chief operating officer of Formula One Management), the whole area of the paddock was surrounded with shatterproof fences, in order to reduce and better manage the people authorised to access them.","In 2003 the second \"Piscine\" curve underwent a treatment similar to that of the first curve, with the shifting of the barriers to improve visibility, while the arrangement of new temporary curbs went to slow down the passage of the cars.","However, the most important novelty was the widening of the port lane: in this way the segment between \"Piscine\" and \"La Rascasse\" could be rectified, becoming faster and less demanding.","The extra space also allowed for the installation of new grandstands and the expansion of the pit lane, which was also equipped with semi-permanent two-storey buildings (instead of the previous tiny prefabricated structures) to better accommodate the teams, the technicians and the material.","Before the 2007 season, the internal curb of the \"Grand Hotel\" hairpin was significantly lowered and widened, in order to allow the single-seaters to climb on it and eventually face the curve with a narrower trajectory.","Since the 2003 edition, the traffic divider at the \"Sainte D\u00e9vote\" curve has been removed in order to widen the track: the track design is now left to the curb only.","This has meant, for safety reasons, an extension of the exit lane from the pits: in practice, once the \"proper\" pit lane has been left, the drivers must remain in the yellow line that \"cuts\" the \"Sainte D\u00e9vote\".","The pit lane was further revised in 2004 by reversing the position of the pits with respect to the lane itself, building a much larger and more welcoming structure.","Monte Carlo has thus become the only Formula 1 circuit in which the pits are not facing the track, but rather physically separate it from the pit lane.","In 2011, after some accidents that occurred during the race weekend (the Mexican driver Sergio P\u00e9rez suffered a rather serious one), the drivers urged a change in the sector between the exit of the tunnel and the \"Nouvelle Chicane\", complaining (above all) about the disconnection of the road surface and incorrect positioning of the guard rail in the escape route opposite the tunnel.","However, these requests were not followed up.","In 2015 the \"Tabac\" curve was re-profiled, slightly anticipating the entrance and thus shortening the track by three metres (from 3,340 metres (10,960ft) to 3,337 metres (10,948ft) today).","The building of the circuit takes six weeks, and the dismantling after the race another three weeks.","The race circuit is narrow, with many elevation shifts and tight corners.","These features make it perhaps the most demanding track in Formula One racing.","Although the course has changed many times during its history, it is still considered the ultimate test of driving skills in Formula One.","It contains both the slowest corner in Formula One (the Fairmont Hairpin, taken at just 48km\/h or 30mph) and one of the quickest (the flat out kink in the tunnel, three turns beyond the hairpin, taken at 260km\/h or 160mph).","Due to the tight and twisty nature of the circuit, it favours the skill of the drivers over the power of the cars.","However, there is very little overtaking as the course is so narrow and dangerous.","Nelson Piquet likened racing round the course to \"riding a bicycle around your living room\".","Prior to 1987, the number of cars starting the race was limited to 20, compared to 26 at other circuits.","The famous tunnel section (running under the Fairmont Hotel, marked in grey in the circuit diagram above) is said to be difficult for drivers to cope with due to the quick switch from light to dark, then back to light again, at one of the fastest points of the course.","As a result, race outcomes tend to be decided by grid positions as well as pit strategies, and the race is extremely hard on gearboxes and brakes.","Several attempts have been made to improve cramped conditions in the pit garages.","In 2002, a substantial amount of land was reclaimed from the harbour to slightly change the shape of one section of the circuit; this left more space for new pit garages, which debuted in the 2004 event.","The circuit is generally recognised to be less safe than other circuits used for Formula One.","Driver and former winner Michael Schumacher stated before the 2012 Grand Prix that the additional risk is \"justifiable once a year\".","If it were not already an existing Grand Prix, it would not be permitted to be added to the Formula One schedule, for safety reasons.","In January 2009, the circuit was voted top of the \"Seven Sporting Wonders of the World\" in a poll of 3,500 British sports fans.","The lap starts with a short sprint up Boulevard Albert Ier, to the tight Sainte-D\u00e9vote corner, named after a small church just beyond the barriers.","This is a nearly 90-degree right-hand bend usually taken in first or second gear.","This corner has seen many first lap accidents, although these are less common since the removal of the mini roundabout on the apex of the corner before the 2003 event, making the entrance to the corner wider.","The cars then head uphill along Avenue d'Ostende, before changing down for the long left-hander at Massenet.","The maximum gradient in this part of the circuit is around 12%.","Out of Massenet, the cars drive past the famous casino before quickly reaching the aptly named Casino Square.","This part of the track is 44 metres higher than the lowest part.","The cars snake down Avenue des Beaux Arts, the next short straight, avoiding an enormous bump on the left of the track, a reminder of the unique nature of the circuit.","This leads to the tight Mirabeau corner, which is followed by a short downhill burst to the even tighter Fairmont Hairpin (was known as the Station Hairpin before the hotel was opened on the site in 1973; the hairpin's name changed depending on the name on the hotel).","It is a corner which has been used for many overtaking manoeuvres in the past.","However, it would be almost physically impossible for two modern F1 cars to go round side by side, as the drivers must use full steering lock to get around.","It is so tight that many Formula 1 teams must redesign their steering and suspension specifically to negotiate this corner.","After the hairpin, the cars head downhill again to a double right-hander called Portier, named after the region of Monaco, before heading into the famous tunnel, a unique feature of a Formula One circuit.","(Until 2009 only one other circuit, Detroit in 1982\u201388, featured a tunnel, but the F1 series now includes racing at the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi, which presents a shorter tunnel at the exit of the pit lane.)","As well as the change of light making visibility poor, a car can lose 20\u201330% of its downforce due to the unique aerodynamic properties of the tunnel.","The tunnel also presents a unique problem when it rains.","As it is virtually indoors, the tunnel usually remains dry while the rest of the track is wet, with only the cars bringing in water from their tyres.","Famously before the very wet 1984 race, Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone had local fire crews wet down the road in the tunnel to give it the same surface grip as the rest of the track.","This was done at the request of McLaren driver Niki Lauda.","Out of the tunnel, the cars have to brake hard for the tight left\u2013right\u2013left Nouvelle Chicane.","This has been the scene of several large accidents, including that of Karl Wendlinger in 1994, Jenson Button in 2003 and Sergio P\u00e9rez in 2011.","The chicane is generally the only place on the circuit where overtaking can be attempted.","There is a short straight to Tabac, so called as there used to be a tobacconist on the outside of the corner.","Tabac is a tight fourth-gear corner which is taken at about 195km\/h (121mph).","Accelerating up to 225km\/h (140mph), the cars reach Piscine, a fast left\u2013right followed by a slower right\u2013left chicane which takes the cars past the Rainier III Nautical Stadium, its swimming pool gives its name to the corner.","Following Piscine, there is a short straight followed by heavy braking for a quick left which is immediately followed by the tight 135-degree right-hander called La Rascasse.","This is another corner that requires full steering lock; it will be remembered for a long time as the location of one of the most suspicious manoeuvres in recent Formula One history during the 2006 season when Michael Schumacher appeared to deliberately stop his car in qualifying so as to prevent Fernando Alonso and Mark Webber\u2013 who were both following and were on flying laps\u2013 from out-qualifying him.","The Rascasse takes the cars into a short straight that precedes the final corner, Virage Antony Nogh\u00e8s.","Named after the organiser of the first Monaco Grand Prix, the corner is a tight right-hander which brings the cars back onto the start-finish straight, and across the line to start a new lap.","Monaco is one of the three circuits which have only one DRS zone, the others being Suzuka and Imola.","During the race, it is active along the pit straight from Antony Nogh\u00e8s to Sainte-D\u00e9vote, for a total of 510 metres.","Monaco's street circuit places very different demands on the cars in comparison to the majority of the other circuits used during a Championship season.","The cars are set up with high downforce; not as is popularly believed to increase cornering speeds, as many of the corners are taken at such a low speed to negate any aerodynamic effect, but instead to shorten braking times and keep the cars stable under acceleration.","Many teams use special wing assemblies incorporating extra active planes in addition to those in use for other circuits.","The Jordan and Arrows teams tried to use new mid-wings in 2001.","The Arrows wing was similar in design to a normal rear wing but smaller and suspended above the nose cone.","Jordan had a small wing suspended on a short pole just in front of the driver.","Both were designed to improve downforce, but, after testing them during Thursday practice, the FIA banned both.","Brake wear is not a problem during a race in Monaco.","Instead, the low speeds mean the issue is keeping the brakes up to working temperature.","The only heavy braking points are at the chicane after the tunnel, and to a lesser extent into the Sainte-D\u00e9vote and Mirabeau corners.","With a lack of temperature, brake bite becomes a problem, as the surface of the carbon brake disc becomes smooth as glass, reducing friction between the pads and the disk, hence lessening braking power.","To combat this, in 2006 Juan Pablo Montoya adopted discs with radial grooves that increased the bite rate between disk and pads, increasing the average temperature of the brakes.","Conversely, cooling the cars' engines is a major concern.","Formula One cars do not incorporate any form of forced cooling, relying solely on air moving over the car to remove heat from the radiator elements.","In the past many teams used to adjust the radiator intakes to allow for extra airflow, creating the once-common \"Monaco nose\".","Before 2014, teams also used closer ratio gears, as there are hardly any long straights in Monaco and acceleration is at a premium (starting from the 2014 season, the same gear ratios must be used throughout the season).","A special steering rack with a larger pinion gear is also fitted to allow the cars to be driven around the tightest corners.","The circuit has been used as a special stage during the WRC Monte Carlo Rally, for example in 2008.","On 18 September 2014 it was announced the Formula E would be racing on a shorter version of the Monaco Grand Prix circuit, which was subsequently used for the 2014\u201315, 2016\u201317 and 2018\u201319 seasons.","This layout omitted the regular section of the track between the climb up the hill at Beau Rivage and the Nouvelle Chicane at the exit of the tunnel, instead turning right immediately after Saint Devote to head downhill, before rejoining the regular layout by way of an 180 degree turn at the chicane.","Monaco was not scheduled to be on the calendar for the second season of Formula E because it took the slot on the calendar filled by the Historic Grand Prix at Monaco every other year.","The inaugural Paris ePrix took its spot on the calendar for season two, with the Monaco ePrix reinstated for season three.","This biennial agreement will continue at least into Formula E's fifth season.","A new track layout will be used for 2021 Monaco ePrix, the layout is similar to the Formula One layout, just there will be differences at turns 1 (Sainte Devote) and 11 (Nouvelle Chicane).","This new layout has length about 3.318km (2.062mi); the distance of layout has increased due to the increase in car performance and range of Gen2 cars.","The Monaco Grand Prix is run on the final Sunday of May, in a transition between spring and summer.","Monaco, in general, has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen Csa), although since the track is only used for a brief period in May, when it is being used it has a narrower temperature range than the principality itself has throughout the year.","For the Monaco Grand Prix, temperatures are usually around 20\u00b0C (68\u00b0F) in terms of ambient conditions, whereas sun exposure can make the track itself a bit warmer than that.","Still, soft tyre compounds often tend to hold up well around Monaco courtesy of surface temperatures being fairly moderate.","The maritime moderation make May heatwaves rather unlikely.","Although the Mediterranean precipitation pattern leads to Monaco being quite dry by late May, due to the urban and narrow nature of the circuit, rainfall combined with the painted areas and the long tunnel makes wet racing extremely challenging.","This was demonstrated by the 1984, 1996, 1997, 2008 and 2016 events.","The 1984 event was red-flagged due to track conditions being deemed too dangerous with the race not being restarted.","In 1996, the mixed-weather conditions caused carnage, paving way for Olivier Panis' shock win in an unfancied Ligier.","The following year, the 1997 race winner Michael Schumacher got the chequered flag after just 62 of the planned 78 laps due to the very slow pace of half a minute slower than dry-weather lap times on the very wet track seeing the clock hit the two hours of maximum time well before the race distance was completed.","The tunnel can be sprinkled under wet conditions to provide for consistent track conditions, although during a full-wet race the tunnel gets drier throughout."]},{"category":"Circuit","circuitId":7,"name":"Circuit Gilles

Grand Prix organizers announced a settlement with Formula One Administration and signed a new five-year contract spanning the 2010\u20132014 seasons.","The 2011 edition took place on June 12 at 1:00 pm (17:00 UTC) and was the longest World Championship Grand Prix ever, due to a lengthy rain delay.","Originally named the \u00cele Notre-Dame Circuit, the circuit was built and finished in 1978.","In what has proven to be the venue's main event over the decades, the FIA Formula One Canadian Grand Prix had been part of the Formula One World Championship for 10 years, and it was previously held at Mosport Park near Toronto on 8 occasions and in 1968 and 1970, the Mont-Tremblant circuit in Quebec.","With safety concerns with Mosport blighting the 1977 event, it was decided to move the race to the new circuit in Montr\u00e9al.","In 1982, it was renamed in honour of Canadian Formula One driver Gilles Villeneuve, father of Jacques Villeneuve, following his death earlier in the year.","The circuit is located in a part of the city of Montr\u00e9al known as Parc Jean-Drapeau.","The park is named after the mayor of Montr\u00e9al who was responsible for the organization of Expo 67.","The race circuit is on Notre Dame Island, a man-made island in the St. Lawrence River most of which was originally built up for the Expo in 1967.","Saint Helen's Island to the northwest was artificially enlarged for the Expo '67 fairgrounds and a prominent remnant of the fair, the Biosphere can be regularly seen during television coverage of racing events.Almost half of the track \u2013 from the hairpin turn until after the pit area \u2013 runs alongside the Olympic Basin, a huge rectangular basin which was created for the rowing and canoeing events of Montr\u00e9al's 1976 Summer Olympics.","Over the winter of 2018-19 the paddock was torn down and completely rebuilt before the Grand Prix.","The old paddock had been in use since 1988.","Barriers run close to the circuit and many experienced drivers have been caught out by them.","A particularly famous part of the circuit is the wall on the outside of the exit of the final chicane before the start\/finish straight.","In 1999 the wall, which bears the name Bienvenue au Qu\u00e9bec (\"Welcome to Quebec\") giving it the nickname \"Mur du Qu\u00e9bec\" (Quebec Wall), ended the race of three Formula One World Champions, Damon Hill, Michael Schumacher and Jacques Villeneuve along with FIA GT champion Ricardo Zonta.","Since then the wall has been nicknamed \"The Wall of Champions\".","In recent years 2009 world champion Jenson Button (2005) and four time World Champion Sebastian Vettel (2011, during free practice) have also fallen victim to the wall.","For the first few years of its existence, the track consisted of technical, medium speed chicanes and a relatively low overall lap speed.","However, over the years the circuit has transformed into a power track, with straight line speed being very much a priority.","Between 1986 and 1988 (with a one year hiatus occurring in 1987), the pitlane and start-finish straight were relocated from the hairpin to the exit of the fast right-left chicane, which became the final corner.","After the fatal crashes of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna at Imola earlier in the year, in 1994 a chicane was inserted between the Casino corner and the hairpin to decrease top speed.","The 1996 race saw both the chicane and the Casino corner removed and the layout changed; the run from the hairpin at the bottom of the circuit was turned into a straight.","In 2002 the exit of the pitlane was changed to make exiting the pitlane safer for drivers.","This also shortened the length of the circuit.","Changes made in 2005 to the curbs on the final chicane were controversial amongst drivers in the run-up to the Grand Prix.","The curbs were made higher and more difficult for the drivers to see, making it even more challenging.","On June 23, 2006, the Canadian Press reported that the city of Montr\u00e9al had awarded exclusive rights to stage the two allowed race weekends on the track to Normand Legault, promoter of the Formula One Canadian Grand Prix.","The deal was for 2007 to 2011, with an option for 2012 to 2016.","Legault decided to replace the Champ Car race with races from the Grand American Road Racing Association's Rolex Series and NASCAR's Nationwide Series, respectively \u2013 the latter series' first race north of the Canada-United States border.","On August 4, 2007, Kevin Harvick made history by winning the first NASCAR Busch Series (now Xfinity Series) race at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in what was one of the most controversial NASCAR races ever, as Robby Gordon claimed to have won the race.","The NASCAR races have affected the circuit layout.","An expansion of the pit lane took place, since a NASCAR pit lane must accommodate a minimum of 43 cars.","The 2008 race made history as the first NASCAR race to run on rain tires.","In 2017, due to the higher cornering speeds of the new Formula One cars and the new safety requirements imposed by the FIA, the circuit had additional Tecpro barriers installed, following the removal of older tire barriers by May 2017.","With the 2017 technical regulations, experts predicted the F1 cars to be quicker by three to five seconds a lap in June at Montr\u00e9al.","2017's F1 event also saw a change to the exit of the last chicane (the Wall of Champions) with its angle modified, because the FIA found it was dangerous.","The complex of turns one and two has become known as the Senna 'S'.","From a bird's eye view turns one and two together can represent an 'S' shape.","Since the pit-exit was redesigned merging into turn two, the 'S' shape is not so evident on first glance.","The very fast Droit du Casino corner (Turn 8) is after the bridge underpass and is known as a 'quick kink' before Turn 9 and the rush to a passing zone at the Hairpin curve.","Turn 10 at \u00cele Notre-Dame is probably the best example of a 180\u00b0 hairpin turn design with full wheel lock during F1 competition.","The various lines taken entering the hairpin curve can predict overtaking on the apex, or exit during race competition.","Braking too late can see racecars offline into the runoff area, and many spinning in front of packed grandstands.","Many overtakes can be seen at this location due to engine differences and drivers' racecraft.","Entering turns 12 & 13 drivers encounter one of the best passing zones completing the long straight after the hairpin.","Many duels have been seen exiting turn 12 with some race cars deciding to cut corner 13 into the run-off, with many going a bit 'too hot' apexing Turn 13 and not exiting intact.","Turn 14 is dubbed the \"Wall of Champions\" after three former Drivers' World Champions found the outside wall in the 1999 race.","In Formula 1 races, a car damaged after gracing the Wall of Champions brings out a Safety Car or VSC.","The exit barrier was previously poignantly marked with advertising by Tourisme Qu\u00e9bec during the F1 event.","As part of Parc Jean-Drapeau, the Circuit is open to visitors, between races, for walking, running, biking, in-line skating, and driving.","During the few days of the Grand Prix, Notre Dame Island is one of the noisiest places in Montr\u00e9al.","Other times of the year, it is one of the quietest, being located in the middle of a river, on an island filled with greenery and animals, joggers and cyclists.","However, on June 4, 2009, administration of Notre Dame Island has forbidden the access of competitive cyclists to the circuit, justifying this as a security measure to avoid the increasing injuries that occurred between year 2008 and 2009.","A total of 27 injuries have been reported.","The ban on cyclists has since been lifted due to protests.","As the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve serves as host to different racing series, it is possible to directly compare different race series' lap times.","In 2006, the last time Champ Car and F1 ran on the same track, Formula One was 5 to 7 seconds faster than Champ Car.","The fastest lap in the Formula One race was 1:15.841 by Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, while S\u00e9bastien Bourdais's fastest lap was 1:22.325 in the Champ Car race.","2007 NASCAR Busch Series driver Patrick Carpentier racing in the NAPA Auto Parts 200, posted a pole time of 1:42.086.","The pole time at the 2012 NAPA Auto Parts 200 was 1:40.865 by Alex Tagliani.","The track record for the Rolex Sports Car Series is 1:32.620.","The time was set by Scott Pruett driving for Chip Ganassi Racing in the Daytona Prototype class in 2010.","The fastest ever lap around the circuit was set by Sebastian Vettel with a time of 1:10.240 set in qualifying (Q3) for the 2019 Canadian Grand Prix.","As this time was set during qualifying, it is not recognized as an official lap record.","Lewis Hamilton set the previous lap record with a time of 1:11.459 during qualifying for the 2017 Canadian Grand Prix, earning him pole position.","This was Hamilton's 65th pole position which put him level with Ayrton Senna in the F1 history books.","After qualifying, Hamilton was awarded a helmet that belonged to his hero as a celebration.","This helmet was sent by Senna's family and was awarded to an emotional Hamilton in front of the crowd."]},{"category":"Circuit","circuitId":8,"name":"Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours","location":"Magny

World Championship in 1991 and annually since 2003.","Magny-Cours has hosted several additional international championships, like the World Sportscar Championship, World Touring Car Championship, FIA GT Championship, World Series by Renault and Formula 3 Euroseries.","Also, the FFSA GT Championship has visited the circuit since 1997.","A campus of the French engineering college Institut sup\u00e9rieur de l'automobile et des transports is also located on the circuit, as well as the museum Conservatoire de la monoplace fran\u00e7aise.","Commonly dubbed Magny-Cours, it was built in 1960 by Jean Bernigaud and was home to the prestigious Winfield racing school (\u00c9cole de Pilotage Winfield), which produced drivers such as Fran\u00e7ois Cevert, Jacques Laffite and Didier Pironi.","However, in the 1980s the track fell into disrepair and was not used for international motor racing until it was purchased by the Departemental Conseil de la Ni\u00e8vre.","In the 1990s, the Ligier Formula One team and its successor Prost were based at the circuit and did much of their testing at Magny-Cours.","The circuit hosted the French Formula One Grand Prix from 1991 until 2008, and the Bol d'Or from 2000 until 2014.","The circuit was re-designed in 2003 and used for a wide range of events include various sports and commercial use.","For the 2003 French Grand Prix, the final corner and chicane were changed in an effort to increase overtaking, with little effect.","Michael Schumacher was able to win the 2004 French Grand Prix using an unprecedented four-stop strategy.","In 2006, Michael Schumacher became the first driver ever to win any single Formula One Grand Prix a total of 8 times and at the same circuit.","Bernie Ecclestone originally confirmed that F1 would not return to Magny-Cours in 2008, instead moving to an alternative location possibly in Paris.","However in a striking U-turn, it was revealed that the 2008 French Grand Prix would take place at Magny-Cours with the release of the official calendar in July 2007.","In May 2008, Ecclestone confirmed that Magny-Cours would stop hosting the French Grand Prix after the 2008 race, suggesting that he was looking into the possibility of hosting the French Grand Prix on the streets of Paris.","The venue suffered from poor attendances due to its remote location, poor access and insufficient accommodation.","In June 2008, the provisional calendar for the 2009 season was released, and a French Grand Prix at Magny-Cours appeared on it, scheduled for 28 June.","However, in October 2008 the 2009 French Grand Prix was cancelled after the French Motorsports Federation (FFSA) withdrew financing for the event.","In 2009 the track hosted its first Superleague Formula event.","It also hosted a second event in 2010.","The circuit was used as part of stage three of the 2014 Paris\u2013Nice cycling race, with the peloton completing almost a full lap of the circuit\u2013 in the reverse direction to its motorsport use\u2013 before the finish on the front straight.","The track nowadays is a smooth circuit with good facilities for the teams, although restricted access prevents spectators from reaching many parts of the circuit.","Unusually, many corners are modelled on famous turns from other circuits, and are named after those circuits, i.e.. the fast Estoril corner (turn 3), the Adelaide hairpin (turn 5) and the N\u00fcrburgring and Imola chicanes (turns 7 and 12 respectively).","It has a mix of slow hairpins and high-speed chicane sections which includes a long fast straight into the first-gear Adelaide hairpin, the best overtaking opportunity on the circuit.","The circuit is very flat with negligible change in elevation (only a small valley at the Estoril corner and a slight hill near the Lycee corner).","The circuit provides few overtaking opportunities, despite modifications in 2003, which means the races here are commonly regarded as quite uneventful.","Formula 1 races at Magny-Cours tend to have a processional nature, with most overtaking occurring during pit stop sequences.","More varied racing occurs when it rains, such as in the 1999 race, which was interrupted by a downpour.","After a restart, most top contenders developed problems, which paved the way for Heinz-Harald Frentzen to claim a surprising victory in his Jordan.","Although the Bol d'Or 24-hour motorcycle endurance race was held at Magny Cours for several years, it returned to the more popular Bugatti circuit at Le Mans in 2015.","The Nevers area has an oceanic climate that is still influenced by its far inland position.","With a yearly precipitation of over 800 millimetres (31in) on average, Magny-Cours is theoretically prone to rain affecting proceedings, although in the Formula One era, it often evaded the rainfall.","There was one notable exception, when both the qualifying and the race of 1999 saw a fully wet track.","With the Grand

Silverstone was the first race in the newly created World Championship of Drivers.","The race rotated between Silverstone, Aintree and Brands Hatch from 1955 to 1986, but settled permanently at the Silverstone track in 1987.","The circuit also hosts the British round of the MotoGP series.","On 30 September 2004 British Racing Drivers' Club president Jackie Stewart announced that the British Grand Prix would not be included on the 2005 provisional race calendar and, if it were, would probably not occur at Silverstone.","However, on 9 December an agreement was reached with former Formula One rights holder Bernie Ecclestone ensuring that the track would host the British Grand Prix until 2009 after which Donington Park would become the new host.","However, the Donington Park leaseholders, Donington Ventures Leisure, ran into severe financial problems and went into administration, resulting in the BRDC signing a 17-year deal with Ecclestone to hold the British Grand Prix at Silverstone.","The escalating costs of the British Grand Prix led to the BRDC triggering a break clause in their contract, meaning that the 2019 British Grand Prix would be the last at the Silverstone Circuit.","Although there was speculation of a street race in London, lengthy negotiations with Liberty Media have led to a new agreement for Silverstone to continue to host the British Grand Prix for a further five years after 2019.","The Silverstone circuit is on the site of a Royal Air Force bomber station, RAF Silverstone, which was operational between 1943 and 1946.","The station was the base for No.","17 Operational Training Unit.","The airfield's three runways, in classic WWII triangle format, lie within the outline of the present track.","The circuit straddles the Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire border and is accessed from the nearby A43.","The Northamptonshire towns of Towcester (5 miles (8.0km)) and Brackley (7 miles (11km)) and Buckinghamshire town of Buckingham (6 miles (9.7km)) are close by, and the nearest large towns are Northampton and Milton Keynes.","Silverstone was first used for motorsport by an 'ad hoc' group of friends who set up an impromptu race in September 1947.","One of their members, Maurice Geoghegan, lived in nearby Silverstone village and was aware that the airfield was deserted.","He and eleven other drivers raced over a 2-mile (3.2km) circuit, during the course of which Geoghegan himself ran over a sheep that had wandered onto the airfield.","The sheep was killed and the car written off, and in the aftermath of this event the informal race became known as the Mutton Grand Prix.","The next year the Royal Automobile Club took a lease on the airfield and set out a more formal racing circuit.","Their first two races were held on the runways themselves, with long straights separated by tight hairpin corners, the track demarcated by hay bales.","However, for the 1949 International Trophy meeting, it was decided to switch to the perimeter track.","This arrangement was used for the 1950 and 1951 Grands Prix.","In 1952 the start line was moved from the Farm Straight to the straight linking Woodcote and Copse corners, and this layout remained largely unaltered for the following 38 years.","For the 1975 meeting a chicane was introduced to try to tame speeds through Woodcote Corner (although MotoGP would still use the circuit without the chicane up until 1986), and Bridge Corner was subtly rerouted in 1987.","The track underwent a major redesign between the 1990 and 1991 races, transforming the ultra-fast track (where in, its last years, fourth or fifth gear, depending on the transmission of the car, was used for every corner except the Bridge chicane which was usually taken in second gear) into a more technical track.","The reshaped track's first Formula One race was won by Nigel Mansell in front of his home crowd.","On his victory lap back to the pits Mansell picked up stranded rival Ayrton Senna to give him a lift on his side-pod after his McLaren had run out of fuel on the final lap of the race.","Following the deaths of Senna and fellow Grand Prix driver Roland Ratzenberger at Imola in 1994, many Grand Prix circuits were modified in order to reduce speed and increase driver safety.","As a consequence of this the entry from Hangar Straight into Stowe Corner was modified in 1995 to improve the run off area.","In addition, the flat-out Abbey kink was modified to a chicane in just 19 days ready for the 1994 Grand Prix.","Parts of the circuit, such as the starting grid, are 17 metres (56ft) wide, complying with the latest safety guidelines.","With the termination of hostilities in Europe in 1945, the first motorsport event in the British Isles was held at Gransden Lodge in 1946 and the next on the Isle of Man, but there was nowhere permanent on the mainland which was suitable.","In 1948, Royal Automobile Club (RAC), under the chairmanship of Wilfred Andrews, set its mind upon running a Grand Prix and started to cast around public roads on the mainland.","There was no possibility of closing the public highway as could happen on the Isle of Man, or the Channel Islands; it was a time of austerity and there was no question of building a new circuit from scratch, so some viable alternative had to be found.","A considerable number of ex-RAF airfields existed, and it was to these the RAC turned their attention to with particular interest being paid to two near the centre of England \u2013 Snitterfield near Stratford-upon-Avon and one behind the village of Silverstone.","The latter was still under the control of the Air Ministry, but a lease was arranged in August 1948 and plans put into place to run the first British Grand Prix since the RAC last ran one at Brooklands in 1927 (those held at Donington Park in the late 1930s had the title of 'Donington Grand Prix').","In August 1948, Andrews employed James Brown on a three-month contract to create the Grand Prix circuit in less than two months.","Nearly 40 years later, Brown died while still employed by the circuit.","Despite possible concerns about the weather, the 1948 British Grand Prix began at Silverstone on Thursday 30 September 1948.","The race took place on 2 October.","The new circuit was marked out with oil drums and straw bales and consisted of the perimeter road and the runaways running into the centre of the airfield from two directions.","Spectators were contained behind rope barriers and the officials were housed in tents.","An estimated 100,000 spectators watched the race.","There were no factory entries but Scuderia Ambrosiana sent two Maserati 4CLT\/48s for Luigi Villoresi and Alberto Ascari who finished in that order (notwithstanding having started from the back of the grid of 25 cars) ahead of Bob Gerard in his ERA R14B\/C.","The race was 239 miles long and was run at an average speed of 72.28mph.","Fourth place went to Louis Rosier's Talbot-Lago T26, followed home by 'Bira' in another Maserati 4CLT\/48.","The second Grand Prix at Silverstone was scheduled for May 1949 and was officially designated the British Grand Prix.","It was to use the full perimeter track with a chicane inserted at Club Corner.","The length of the second circuit was exactly three miles and the race run over 100 laps, making it the longest post-war Grand Prix held in England.","There were again 25 starters and victory went to a 'San Remo' Maserati 4CLT\/48, this time in the hands of Toulo de Graffenried, from Bob Gerard in his familiar ERA and Louis Rosier in a 4\u00bd-litre Talbot-Lago.","The race average speed had risen to 77.31mph.","The attendance was estimated at anything up to 120,000.","Also in 1949, the first running took place of what was to become an institution at Silverstone, the International Trophy sponsored by the Daily Express and which become virtually a second Grand Prix.","The first International Trophy was run on 20 August in two heats and a final.","Victory in heat one went to Prince Birabongse ('Bira') and the second to Giuseppe Farina \u2013 both driving Maserati 4CLT\/48s, but the final went to a Ferrari Tipo 125 driven by Alberto Ascari from Farina, with Luigi Villoresi third in another Ferrari.","For this meeting, the chicane at Club Corner was dispensed with and the circuit took up a shape that was to last for 25 years.","The 1950 British Grand Prix was a significant occasion for two reasons: it was the first ever World Championship Grand Prix, carrying the title of the European Grand Prix; and the event was graced by the presence of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth \u2013 the first and only time a reigning monarch has attended a motor race in Britain.","The year was the institution of the World Championship for Driver, and Silverstone witnessed the first time that Alfa Romeo 158 'Alfettas' had been seen in England, and they took the first three places in the hands of Giuseppe Farina, Luigi Fagioli and Reg Parnell, with the race average having increased to 90.96mph; however the race distance had been reduced to 205 miles.","1951 was memorable for it saw the defeat of the Alfas, with victory going to the popular Argentinian driver, Froil\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez driving the Ferrari 375.","His fellow countryman Juan Manuel Fangio was second in an Alfa Romeo 159B, and Luigi Villoresi in another Ferrari 375 was third.","The race distance had increased to 263 miles, and the race average speed was now 96.11mph.","1951 also saw the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC) take over the lease from the RAC, and set about making the circuit into something more permanent.","The International Trophy attracted the cream of Formula One, including the seemingly invincible Alfas, driven by Fangio and Farina.","However, the weather worsened for the final and visibility was almost nil, and in those conditions the Alfettas with their supercharged engines were at a distinct disadvantage.","When the race was abandoned after only six laps, Reg Parnell was in the lead in the \"Thinwall Special\"; no official winner was declared.","In 1952, the RAC decided it no longer wished to run the circuit, and on 1 January the lease was taken on by the BRDC, with James Brown continuing as track manager.","The lease covered only the perimeter track and other areas at specific times.","The original pits between Abbey and Woodcote were demolished, and new pit facilities were constructed between Woodcote and Copse.","Coinciding with the BRDC taking over the running of the Grand Prix, there was a little unrest within the sport which led to the downgrading of Grand Prix racing to Formula Two, which was won by Alberto Ascari at 90.9mph from his Ferrari teammate Piero Taruffi \u2013 both driving the Tipo 500.","The podium was completed by Mike Hawthorn driving a Cooper-Bristol T12.","The International Trophy was notable in 1952, in that it saw a rare victory for Hersham and Walton Motors when Lance Macklin had a win.","The same situation continued into 1953 with the World Championship being run for Formula Two cars.","The race was a straight fight between the Maserati and Ferrari teams, with victory going to Ascari at 92.9mph aboard a Ferrari Tipo 500, from the Maserati A6GCM of Fangio and another Tipo 500 of Farina.","The racecard included a Formula Libre race which put the Grand Prix into perspective; Farina drove the Thinwall Special to victory at a higher speed than the actual GP, setting the first lap record at over 100mph, at 100.16mph.","The 1954 Grand Prix season was the new 2.5-litre Formula One and had attracted interest from some major players.","Lancia had joined the fray with their D50, and Daimler-Benz were back; the appearance of Lancia meant that there were three Italian teams competing at the highest level, the others being Ferrari and Maserati.","The British were catered for by the Owen Racing Organisation with their BRMs, the Vanwall of Tony Vandervell and Connaught still competing, while Cooper-Bristol were not to be forgotten.","At the start of the season, Mercedes-Benz had swept all before them, but Silverstone was a d\u00e9b\u00e2cle for the team, which returned to Untert\u00fcrkheim in defeat.","The 263-mile race was won by Gonz\u00e1lez from Hawthorn in the works 625s, with Onofre Marim\u00f3n third in the works Maserati 250F.","The best Mercedes driver was pole-man Fangio in his W196.","From 1955, the Grand Prix was alternated between Aintree and Silverstone, until 1964 when Brands Hatch took over as the alternative venue.","By the time the Grand Prix returned to Silverstone in 1956, Mercedes-Benz had gone, as had Lancia as an independent entrant, the cars having been handed to Scuderia Ferrari, who ran them as 'Lancia-Ferraris'.","The great Fangio scored his only British Grand Prix win in one of these cars.","Second was another Lancia-Ferrari which had started the race in the hands of Alfonso de Portago, but was taken over by Peter Collins at half-distance and third place was Jean Behra in a Maserati 250F.","Matters were somewhat happier for the British enthusiast at the International Trophy; a quality field had been attracted including Fangio and Collins in their Lancia-Ferraris, but the 13 laps of the race were led by the new BRM P25 driven by Hawthorn.","When the engine of the BRM expired, Stirling Moss in the Vanwall took over, going on to win.","With the Lancias broken by the Brit, the rest of the podium was taken by the Connaughts of Archie Scott Brown and Desmond Titterington.","For 1958 drastic rule changes were introduced into Formula One, Fangio had retired and Maserati had withdrawn due to financial difficulties.","Throughout the season the battle was between Ferrari and Vanwall and it was fervently hoped that Vandervell would success at home but it was not to be; the green cars fell apart, Stuart Lewis-Evans the best placed finisher in fourth.","Victory went to Collins from Hawthorn, both driving Ferrari Dino 246s.","The crowd of 120,000 witnessed a hat-trick of English drivers on the podium with Roy Salvadori coming home third in one of John Cooper's Coventry-Climax rear-engined powered cars.","At the British Grand Prix of 1960, the front-engined cars were completely outclassed, the podium going to the Coventry-Climax\u2013powered cars, with victory going to Jack Brabham in the works Cooper T53 from John Surtees and Innes Ireland in their Lotus 18s.","Although the race is remembered as the race lost by Graham Hill, rather than won by Brabham.","Hill stalled his BRM on the grid, left the line in last place, then proceeded to carve through the whole field.","Once in the lead, the BRM was troubled by fading brakes which led to Hill spinning off at Copse Corner.","1961 was the year of the new 1.5 litre Formula One introduced by the governing body on safety grounds \u2013 it met with strong opposition in Britain which gave birth to the short-lived 'Inter-Continental Formula', which extended the life of the now-obsolete Formula One cars.","The International Trophy was run to this Formula and produced a notable first and last \u2013 the first and only appearance of the American Scarab and the last appearance of the Vanwall, in the hands of Surtees.","The race was wet and Moss demonstrated his supreme prowess in Rob Walker's Cooper by lapping all but Brabham twice.","In 1962, the second year of the Formula, the International Trophy was run for the 1.5 litre cars.","This was the classic occasion when Hill in the BRM crossed the finishing line almost sideways to snatch victory from Jim Clark's Lotus 24; both drivers were credited with the same race time.","Clark was to win the British Grand Prix when it returned to Silverstone in 1963, driving the Lotus-Climax 25.","By now, even Ferrari had succumbed to the rear-engined layout, but sent only one to Northamptonshire for Surtees (Ferrari 156).","He finished second, ahead of three BRM P57's of Hill, Richie Ginther and Lorenzo Bandini.","For the 1965 season, BRM had taken a chance and signed Jackie Stewart straight from Formula Three; the International Trophy was only his fourth Formula One race, but despite this he won handsomely from Surtees in the Ferrari.","When the Formula One returned for the British Grand Prix later that year, Stewart finished a creditable fifth.","Fellow Scot, Clark won the race in his Lotus-Climax 33 from the BRM P261 of Hill and the Ferrari of Surtees.","The following year, the new 3-litre Formula One was heralded as the \"Return of Power\", however the first Grand Prix under these regulations was held at Brands Hatch.","It was not until 1967 that the big-engined cars came to Northamptonshire.","The result remained unchanged, with Clark winning in the Lotus-Cosworth 49 at a race average speed of 117.6mph.","Second was Kiwi Denny Hulme aboard the Brabham-Repco, from the Ferrari 312 of his fellow countrymen Chris Amon.","There was a frightening increase in race average speed in 1969, for it rose by 10mph, to 127.2mph when Stewart won in his Matra-Cosworth MS80 from Jacky Ickx (Brabham-Cosworth BT26) and Bruce McLaren driving one of his own Cosworth-powered M7Cs.","By 1971, the 3-litre era was now into its fifth season; it was also the year when sponsorship came to the fore.","Ken Tyrrell became a constructor and Jackie Stewart won at Silverstone driving the Tyrrell 003 on his way to a second World Championship.","Ronnie Peterson was second in March 711 from Emerson Fittipaldi in Lotus 72D; all were Cosworth-powered in what fast becoming Formula Super Ford; the race average was 130.5mph.","1973 was the year that Jody Scheckter lost control of his McLaren at the completion of the first lap, spinning into the pit wall and setting in motion the biggest accident ever seen on a British motor racing circuit.","The race was stopped on lap two and the carnage cleared away; it speaks highly for the construction of the cars that only one driver was injured.","The race was won Scheckter's teammate, Peter Revson (McLaren M23-Cosworth) from Peterson (Lotus 72E) and Denny Hulme (McLaren M23).","The race average speed had risen again to 131.75mph.","The 1973 d\u00e9b\u00e2cle wrought changes upon Silverstone as it was deemed necessary to slow these cars through Woodcote, therefore a chicane was inserted.","\"Formula Super Ford\" reached its peak in 1975, when 26 of the 28 entries were Cosworth-powered, there being just two Ferraris to challenge them.","Tom Pryce placed his Shadow DN5 on pole for the 1975 Grand Prix, but an accident destroyed his chances as the race was run in appalling weather and it was stopped at two-thirds distance, following multiple cars crashing on the very wet circuit.","Victory went to Fittipaldi (McLaren M23) from Carlos Pace (Brabham BT44B) and Scheckter (Tyrrell 007).","International motor racing at Silverstone is not concerned solely to Formula One, however, and 1976 saw one of the closest finished in endurance racing during the Silverstone Six-Hour race, which was a round of the World Championship for Makes.","The series was almost a German benefit that season as the main contenders were the Porsche 935s and BMW 3-litre CSLs (common known as the 'Batmobiles').","Porsche had had the upper hand in the opening rounds of the series, but at Silverstone things were different.","John Fitzpatrick and Tom Walkinshaw kept their BMW ahead to win by 197 yards (1.18secs) from the Bob Wollek\/Hans Heyer Porsche 935 Turbo.","Third was a Porsche 934 Turbo in the hands of Leo Kinnunen and Egon Evertz.","The 1977 British Grand Prix saw the beginning of a revolution in Formula One, for towards the back of the grid was the product of R\u00e8gie Renault which was exploiting a rule in F1 regulations that allowed the use of 1.5-litre turbocharged engines.","The Renault RS01 expired early in the race.","Ulsterman John Watson had an early battle with James Hunt, but the fuel system in Watson's Brabham-Alfa Romeo let him down and the winner Hunt (McLaren M26) won at a speed of 130.36, with Niki Lauda second for Ferrari from Gunnar Nilsson in a Lotus.","Once the most prestigious race of the motorcycle calendar, the Isle of Man TT had been increasingly boycotted by the top riders, and finally succumbed to pressure and was dropped, being replaced by the British Motorcycle Grand Prix.","1977 marked the beginning of this era, and Silverstone was the chosen venue.","It took place on 14 August, with Pat Hennen riding a Suzuki RG500 to victory from Steve Baker (Yamaha).","The International Trophy attracted World Championship contenders for the last time in 1978 but the race witnessed the d\u00e9but of the epoch-making Lotus 79 in the hands of Mario Andretti.","Such events as this gave the Formula One also-rans a chance to start, which they were normally denied in Grands Prix; two such were the Theodore and Fittipaldi.","Keke Rosberg won the former in atrocious conditions from Fittipaldi in his namesake car.","14 May witnessed the running of the Silverstone Six-Hours, a round of the World Championship for Makes.","A 3.2-litre Porsche 935 won in the hands of Jacky Ickx and Jochen Mass from a 3.0-litre version driven by Wollek and Henri Pescarolo; third and fourth were BMW 320s handled by Harald Grohs\/Eddy Joosen and Freddy Kottulinsky\/Markus Hotz.","The race was run over 235 laps of the Grand Prix circuit to make a total of a little over 689 miles which the winning car covered at 114.914mph.","Come the 1979 Grand Prix and the passage of two years had made a great difference to the performance of the turbocharged Renaults; the car which qualified on the last row in 1977 was now on the front row beside Alan Jones in the Williams FW07.","When Jones's Cosworth expired, his teammate Clay Regazzoni moved into the lead, going on to win from Ren\u00e9 Arnoux in the Renault RS10 with Jean-Pierre Jarier third in the Tyrrell 009.","The winners average speed was 138.80mph.","The 1979 British Motorcycle Grand Prix was again held at Silverstone and would be one of the closest races in the history of Motorcycle Grand Prix racing.","The 1978 winner Kenny Roberts and the pair of works Suzuki riders, Barry Sheene and Wil Hartog broke away from the rest of the field.","After a few laps, Hartog fell off the pace as Sheene and Roberts continued to swap the lead throughout the 28-lap event, the American winning for the second time ahead of Sheene by a narrow margin of just three-hundreds of a second.","In May 1980, sports cars returned in form of the Silverstone Six-Hours, which was won by Alain de Cadenet driving a car bearing his own name, partnered by Desir\u00e9 Wilson; the 235 laps (687 miles) being completed at 114.602mph.","The only other to complete the full race distance was the Siegfried Brunn\/J\u00fcrgen Barth (Porsche 908\/3), with a Porsche 935K Turbo driven by John Paul and Brian Redman third, a lap down.","1981 saw the arrival of the one-one-one grid, staggered in two rows.","The turbocharged era saw Renault occupying the front row of the grid, and turbo-engined Ferraris fourth and eighth.","The Renaults dominated the race, but total reliability was still lacking and the victory went to John Watson in a McLaren MP4\/1.","Second place went to Carlos Reutemann in the Williams FW07C from the Talbot-Ligier JS17 of Jacques Laffite, a lap down; the race speed was down a little at 137.64mph.","For 1982, endurance sport car racing entered a rejuvenated phrase with the coming of Group C; the BRDC and l'Automobile Club de l'Ouest instituted a joint Silverstone\/Le Mans Challenge Trophy.","The trophy eventually went to Jacky Ickx and Derek Bell in a Porsche 956, but at Silverstone they could not make maximum use of the fuel allowance and victory went to the Lancia LC1 of Riccardo Patrese and Michele Alboreto.","The winning car completed the 240 laps at a speed of 128.5mph, with the second-place car three laps adrift, that of Ickx\/Bell.","The final podium place went to the Joest Racing Porsche 936C Turbo of Bob Wollek\/Jean-Michel Martin\/Philippe Martin.","May 1983 saw the running of the Silverstone 1000 kilometres, which was a round of the newly instigated World Endurance Championship.","Porsche dominated the event, taking the first five places, with Derek Bell and Stefan Bellof bringing their 956 home ahead of Wollek and Stefan Johansson in an identical car.","In the 1983 British Grand Prix, the first Cosworth-powered car was in 13th place on the grid, all the cars ahead of it being powered by turbocharged engines.","Fuel consumption of the turbos was heavy and refuelling mid-race had become necessary.","With the ever-increasing power, speeds were continually on the up and in practice Ren\u00e9 Arnoux became the first person to lap the circuit in under 1:10.000 with a time of 1:09.462 in his Ferrari 126C3, a lap at over 150mph.","In the race, the lap record was raised to over 140mph by Frenchman Alain Prost, who won the race in the Renault RE40 at an average speed of 139.218mph, from Nelson Piquet in the Brabham-BMW BT52B and Patrick Tambay in a Ferrari.","Finishing fourth, also using Renault power, was the Lotus 94T of Nigel Mansell.","The 1985 International Trophy, run on 24 March, was the inaugural event under the regulations for the new International Formula 3000.","New Zealand driver Mike Thackwell won the International Trophy for the third time, and the first F3000 race in the process, driving a Ralt RT20 from John Nielsen in a similar car.","Third place went a March 85B driven by Michel Fert\u00e9.","Six weeks later, sports cars returned for the Silverstone 1000km.","Porsche cars took five of the top six placings in the shape of four 962Cs and a 956.","The winners were the works pairing of Ickx\/Mass from their teammates Bell and Hans-Joachim Stuck; third was the Lancia-Martini of Patrese and Alessandro Nannini.","The 1985 British Grand Prix saw Keke Rosberg in his 1,150bhp (858kW; 1,166PS) Williams FW10-Honda set a qualifying lap at over 160mph.","Three others clocked an average lap speed of over 159mph.","Rosberg set his time despite a deflating rear tyre and the track still being slightly damp from earlier rain.","The turbo era had reached its zenith, and while Prost put the lap record up to 150.035mph, like most races of the era it was something of an economy run as the FIA had limited fuel capacities (220 litres per car per race).","Prost went on the win in the race, in the McLaren MP4\/2B, at an average of 146.246mph from the Ferrari 156\/85 of Alboreto and the Ligier JS25 of Laffite.","The International season opened on 13 April with the first round of the Intercontinental F3000 Championship.","The first home was Pascal Fabr\u00e9 with a Lola T86\/50 from Emanuele Pirro (March) and Nielsen (Ralt).","In 1986, the Silverstone 1000km run on 5 May was a round of the World Endurance Championship, which Silk Cut Jaguar (Tom Walkinshaw Racing) won.","The Derek Warwick\/Eddie Cheever XJR9 was the only car to complete the distance of 212 laps, at a speed of 129.05mph.","The Stuck\/Bell Porsche 962C was two laps down in second place, with a 962C a further three laps adrift in the hands of Jo Gartner and Tiff Needell.","Due to safety concerns over high speeds, by the time the Grand Prix returned in Silverstone in 1987, a new corner had been inserted before Woodcote.","The first International meeting in 1987 was the initial round of the Intercontinental F3000 Championship on 12 April.","The race was run at 103.96mph, the winner being Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin in a Ralt from Michel Troll\u00e9 in a Lola and Roberto Moreno aboard another Ralt.","In 1987, Jaguar won the Silverstone 1000km, their fourth successive win in the World Sports Car Championship.","The XJR8s took a one-two finish, with the car of Cheever and Raul Boesel winning ahead of Jan Lammers and Watson, with the Porsche 962C of Stuck and Bell third; these three crews covered the whole lap distance of 210 laps of the full GP circuit, the winning Jaguar averaging 123.42mph.","From the 1987 British Grand Prix onwards, the event was firmly established at Silverstone.","The first two placings in 1987 were a repeat of the 1986 race at Brands Hatch, Mansell winning from his Williams-Honda teammate Piquet at 146.208mph and Ayrton Senna in the Lotus-Honda.","Following a mid-race pit stop in a bid to cure a vibration in the car, Mansell found himself 29 seconds behind Piquet with 28 laps to go.","He quickly cut Piquet's lead by more than a second per lap, until with five laps to go the gap was only 1.6 seconds.","With two laps to go, Mansell slipstreamed Piquet down the Hangar Straight, jinked left and then dived right to pass Piquet into Stowe.","To a tumultuous reception, Mansell went on to win the race.","1987 saw the inaugural World Touring Car Championship arrive at Silverstone.","Luis P\u00e9rez-Sala led the race until the penultimate lap, with a lead of nearly one minute, but then his Bigazzi-entered BMW M3 retired.","He had not been sure that the car would start the race after Olivier Grouillard rolled it in practice.","However, the Munich marque still took victory when the CiBiEmme Sport's M3 finished first, in the hands of Enzo Calderari and Fabio Mancini.","The Schnitzer M3 of Roberto Ravaglia, Roland Ratzenberger and Pirro managed to finished second, ahead of the Alfa Romeo 75 Turbo of Giorgio Francia and Nicola Larini.","The 1988 race was won at 124.142mph, the dramatic reduction in race speed being due to heavy rain.","Senna took victory in his McLaren from Mansell (Williams) and Nannini (Benetton).","The 1988 Silverstone 1000km saw Cheever take a hat-trick of victories for Jaguar, this time partnered by Martin Brundle.","The XJR9 won at 128.02mph from the Sauber-Mercedes C9 driven by Jean-Louis Schlesser and Mass.","The second Sauber driven by Mauro Baldi and James Weaver, was third, two laps down, while third on the road was the Porsche 962C of Bell and Needell which was disqualified for an oversize fuel tank.","April 1989 saw the first round of the 1989 International F3000 Championship.","Thomas Danielsson won at the wheel of a Reynard 89D, at a speed of 131.56mph.","Second by 0.5secs was Philippe Favre in a Lola T89\/50 from Mark Blundell and Jean Alesi in Reynards.","Mid-July is the traditional time for the British Grand Prix and on the 16th, over 90,000 spectators converged upon the circuit to see Prost score his 38th GP win in the McLaren-Honda MP4\/5, at 143.694mph.","Mansell brought the Ferrari 641 into second place from Nannini's Benetton.","The weekend of 19\/20 May 1990 was a busy one at Silverstone, for on the Saturday, a round of the FIA F3000 Championship was run on the Grand Prix circuit, and on the Sunday the contenders in the World Sports-Prototype Championship had their turn.","In the F3000 race, Scotland's Allan McNish led \u00c9rik Comas home from Marco Apicella.","The first two were Lola-Mugen T90\/50 mounted, while the third-placed car was a Reynard-Mugen 90D.","The sports cars again ran over 300 miles, contesting the Shell BRDC Empire Trophy.","The first three places went to British cars, with Jaguar first and second from a Spice-Cosworth in the hands of Ferm\u00edn V\u00e9lez and Bruno Giacomelli.","The winning Jaguar XJR11 of Martin Brundle and Michel Fert\u00e9 was the only to run the full distance of 101 laps, lapping even the second-placed XJR11 of Jan Lammers and Andy Wallace.","And so to July, and the British Grand Prix.","Once again, it was over 190 miles and was won at 145.253mph.","Alain Prost was now driving for Ferrari and his victory was rounded by Thierry Boutsen in the Williams in second, and Ayrton Senna's McLaren in third.","After the Grand Prix, it had already been decided to extensively redesign Silverstone's layout.","Nearly every part of Silverstone (except Copse, Abbey and all of the straights, save the Farm Straight) was redesigned.","The ultra-high speed Club and Stowe corners were made slower and a chicane was placed before Club.","Maggotts, Becketts and Chapel were re-designed as very fast snaky esses that proved to be even more challenging than the original series of corners \u2013 the considerable amount of lateral acceleration change from side to side became the highlighted challenge of the new circuit.","A new twisty infield section called Luffield was created in place of the Farm straight and the Bridge chicane.","Despite these alterations, the Grand Prix and World Sportscar circuses both very much approved of the new layout: Silverstone was still fast, which is what it has always been known for.","When the Group C cars returned in 1991, they raced for the World Sports Car Championship, but the race distance was reduced to 269 miles (83 laps of the GP circuit) and it was a straight battle between Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz, with victory going to the Jaguar XJR14 of Teo Fabi and Derek Warwick at a speed of 122.048mph.","In second place, four laps behind, came the Mercedes C291 of Michael Schumacher and Karl Wendlinger, followed by the singleton driver XJR14 of Brundle.","July came, and with it came, of course, the Grand Prix.","The almost unbelievably popular victory was Nigel Mansell's 18th Grand Prix win, making him the most successful English driver ever.","Only two other drivers completed the full race distance: Gerhard Berger for McLaren and Prost for Ferrari.","1992 was once more a very busy International season for Silverstone with a round of the International F3000 Championship, the World Sports Car Championship, and of course, the Grand Prix.","The first two were run on the same day, 10 May.","Although the practice was spoilt by hailstorm, the races were run in bright weather.","The F3000 victor was Jordi Gen\u00e9 who completed the 37 laps at a speed of 121.145mph in a Reynard-Mugen 92D, from a similar Judd-engined example in the hands of Rubens Barrichello.","Lola-Cosworth were third and fourth, driven by Olivier Panis and Emanuele Naspetti.","The sports car race was a sad affair, with but a handful of cars coming to the grid.","There were 11 starters and just five finishers.","The race was won by the Peugeot 905 of Warwick and Yannick Dalmas at 122.661mph, two laps ahead of the Maurizio Sandro Sala\/Johnny Herbert Mazda MXR-01 which was four laps ahead of the Lola-Judd T92\/10 driven by J\u00e9sus Pareja and Stefan Johansson.","At the end of the season, the World Sports Car Championship was no more.","The Grand Prix was a happier affair with Williams-Renaults of Mansell and Riccardo Patrese taking top honours from the Benettons of Brundle and Schumacher.","Mansell dominated practice and the race, winning at 133.772mph.","Six days after competing at Donington Park, the F3000 guys were at Silverstone for the second round of the 1993 International F3000 Championship.","Gil de Ferran won at 119.462mph from David Coulthard and Michael Bartels \u2013 all were driving Cosworth powered Reynard 93Ds.","Despite back-to-back Grand Prix victories for Williams, Mansell would not be back in 1993 to try for a famous hat-trick as he was racing in the States.","However, things looked good his replacement, Damon Hill after he set fastest time in practice, but Prost (now at Williams) pipped him to pole by just 0.128secs and he went on to win the race after Hill's engine exploded 18 laps from home.","Second and third were the Benettons of Schumacher and Patrese.","A year later, the Grand Prix was a race of controversy which rumbled on for most of the season: Hill was barely ahead of Schumacher on the grid and on the formation lap the young German sprinted ahead of the Englishmen which was not allowed under the rules (cars were required to maintain station during the formation lap).","The race authorities informed Benetton that their man had been penalised 5 seconds for his transgression but they did not realise that it was a stop\/go penalty and did not call Schumacher in, so he was black-flagged.","Schumacher ignored the black flag for six laps, and for failing to respond to the black flag Schumacher was disqualified, having finished second on the road.","Hill won the race from Jean Alesi in the Ferrari and Mika H\u00e4kkinen in the McLaren.","The 1994 F3000 race was an all Reynard 94D affair.","The 38-lap race was won by Franck Lagorce winning at 119.512mph, from Coulthard and de Ferran.","The race distance for the following season had increased by two.","Victorious on this occasion was Riccardo Rosset driving Super Nova's Reynard-Cosworth AC 95D.","His teammate Vincenzo Sospiri finished second, while Allan McNish was third in a Zytek-Judd KV-engined 95D.","Hill and Schumacher were not having a happy 1995 and managed to take each other off after the final pit stops, leaving Coulthard in the lead which he lost when he had to take a 10 sec 'stop\/go' penalty for speeding in the pit lane.","All of this left Herbert to take his maiden Grand Prix win \u2013 he was euphoric and was held shoulder high on the podium by the second and third-placed men, Coulthard and Alesi.","On 12 May 1996, the Northamptonshire circuit hosted a round of the International BPR series which was very a British affair.","First was the McLaren F1 GTR of Andy Wallace and Olivier Grouillard followed by the Jan Lammers\/Perry McCarthy Lotus Esprit and another McLaren in the hands of James Weaver and Ray Bellm.","At the Grand Prix on 14 July, Damon Hill qualfied first.","He spun out of contention when a front wheel nut became loose, and his teammate Jacques Villeneuve went on to win at a fraction over 124mph, from Berger's Benetton and the McLaren of H\u00e4kkinen.","The 1997 Grand Prix was again won by Villeneuve at the wheel of a Williams-Renault at a speed of 128.443mph from the Benettons of Alesi and Alexander Wurz.","From the start of 1998, the FIA decreed that all Formula One grids must be straight: in order to comply with this, the RAC moved the start line forward at Silverstone but not, significantly, the finish line.","This led to some confusion at the end of the Grand Prix, which was scheduled for 60 laps, but was effectively 59.95 laps.","With the timing being taken from the finish line and not the start line, the winning car was in the pits at the end of the race and the Ferrari pit was situated between the two lines.","The chequered flag is supposed to be waved at the winning car and then showed to the other competitors, but it was waved at the second man who thought that he had won.","Victory went to Schumacher at the wheel of a Ferrari in appalling conditions.","In addition to pit lane confusion, he was penalised 10 seconds for passing another racer under a yellow flag.","The stewards failed to inform the teams of their decision in the proper manner so Schumacher took his stop go penalty in the pits, after the race was over.","McLaren appealed to the FIA, but the appeal was rejected and the results were confirmed, with H\u00e4kkinen second in the McLaren and Eddie Irvine third in the second Ferrari.","Victory in the 1999 British Grand Prix went to Coulthard's McLaren-Mercedes with an average speed of 124.256mph.","For Silverstone's first Grand Prix of the 21st Century, the FIA decreed that the race should be moved to April, and the event took place over Easter, with the GP itself run on Easter Sunday.","In hindsight this was a poor decision by the FIA, who failed to take into account the unpredictable weather in Britain at this time of year.","It rained almost continually for the best part of three weeks before the event and most of Good Friday; by Easter Saturday the car parks had virtually collapsed and were completely closed.","Although most of the race day itself was fine, the damage was done and many thousands of spectators were unable to get to Silverstone to witness David Coulthard win his second straight victory in the event, from his McLaren teammate Mika H\u00e4kkinen, with Michael Schumacher third for Ferrari.","On 14 May, the FIA GT Championship came to Northants, in slightly more clement conditions and victory went to Julian Bailey and Jamie Campbell-Walter driving a Lister Storm GT from no fewer than four Chrysler Viper GTS-Rs.","The 2000 Silverstone 500 USA Challenge was the first American Le Mans Series race to be held outside of North America.","It served as a precursor to the creation of the European Le Mans Series by gauging the willingness of European teams from the FIA Sportscar Championship and FIA GT Championship to participate in a series identical to the American Le Mans Series.","This event also shared the weekend at Silverstone with an FIA GT round, with some GT teams running both events.","The race was won by the Schnitzer Motorsport's BMW V12 LMP of J\u00f6rg M\u00fcller and JJ Lehto.","Formula One returned for the 2001 British Grand Prix in July to see H\u00e4kkinen triumph having managing to overtake the driver in pole, Schumacher.","Schumacher, driving for Ferrari finished second while teammate Barrichello gained the final spot in the podium.","The 2002 British Grand Prix saw Ferrari return to the top two steps of the podium with Schumacher beating Barrichello, while pole-sitter and Williams driver Juan Pablo Montoya finished in third.","These three drivers, as well as gaining the top three qualifying places, were the only drivers to finish on the lead lap.","Although the 2003 Grand Prix was won by pole-sitter Barrichello for Ferrari, the race is probably most remember for a track invasion by the defrocked priest, Neil Horan, who ran along Hangar Straight, head-on to the 175mph train of cars, wearing a saffron kilt and waving religious banners.","Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen (McLaren) was pressured by Barrichello into losing the lead and an unforced error later on allowed Montoya to seize second.","Neil Hodgson had a brilliant World Superbike meeting in 2003.","The Fila Ducati rider withstood the attention of James Toseland in the first race and then fellow Ducati pilot, Gregorio Lavilla in the second, just 0.493secs ahead of the Spaniard.","Rub\u00e9n Xaus claimed two third-place finishes.","Schumacher celebrated his 80th Grand Prix victory of his career at the 2004 event after taking the lead from R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen during the first round of pit stops.","Barrichello completed the podium in third, and coming home in fourth was BAR's Jenson Button.","A crowd of 68,000 saw Renegade Ducati's Noriyuki Haga and Ten Kate Honda's Chris Vermeulen take a win each in the 2004 World Superbike event.","Haga pulled off a close finish in race one, just beating Vermeulen.","In race two, the roles were reversed with the Honda beating the Ducati.","When the Le Mans Prototypes returned in 2004, they raced for the Le Mans Series over a distance of 1000km.","It was a straight battle between the pair of Audi R8's of Audi Sport UK Team Veloqx and Team Goh's singleton R8, with victory going to the Veloqx pair of Allan McNish and Pierre Kaffer.","In second place, one lap behind was Rinaldo Capello and Seiji Ara for Team Goh, followed by the all English pair of Johnny Herbert and Jamie Davies for Veloqx.","A crowd of 27,000 welcomed back the World Touring Car Championship.","The Alfa Romeo drivers dominated the first race, on a sunny 15 May 2005.","Gabriele Tarquini scored a lights to flag victory, leading home an Alfa quartet.","Behind the Italian, a tough fight for second between James Thompson and Fabrizio Giovanardi, with a number of overtaking and paint swapping moves, also involving the BMW 320i of Andy Priaulx.","Augusto Farfus completed the quartet, with Priaulx dropping back to fifth.","After a superb start, Priaulx led most of race two, until side-lined with a puncture.","This enabled the SEAT duo of Rickard Rydell and Jason Plato to take the win for the Spanish manufacturer, with Tarquini in third.","Ducati took both legs of the 2005 World Superbike double-header.","Regis Laconi scored the first win and Toseland doubled Ducati's pleasure.","Laconi beat Troy Corser to the finishing line by 0.096secs.","Toseland claimed third on the podium.","Toseland turn came to Race 2, when he passed Croser and Haga.","Montoya won the 2005 British Grand Prix.","In the 2005 Le Mans Series race, Team ORECA Audi R8 scored a prestigious victory, with McNish, this time paired with St\u00e9phane Ortelli, winning after a thrilling race-long battle with the Creation Autosportif's DBA 03S of Nicolas Minassian and Campbell-Walter, a car that provided much of the season's excitement.","Alonso would see the chequered flag first as he wins again at Silverstone in 2006.","In doing so, the Spaniard became the youngest driver to get the hat-trick (pole position, winning and fastest lap).","Alonso won by nearly 14 seconds from Schumacher and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen took third again.","Troy Bayliss gained a pair of wins in the 2006 World Superbike, aboard his Xerox Ducati.","Haga (Yamaha) and Toseland (Honda) joined Bayliss on the podium in both races.","Following Hamilton's victory in the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix, Silverstone reported that ticket sales had \"gone through the roof\"; circuit director Ian Phillips added, \"we haven't seen this level of interest since Mansell-mania in the late 80s and early 90s\".","Hamilton qualified his McLaren on pole.","However, race day saw R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen move ahead during the first round of pit stops.","The other McLaren driver, Alonso, finished second.","Bayliss (Ducati) took the chequered flag in a solitary 2007 World Superbike race, with a heavy downpour causing the first race to be run in the wet, with Race 2 cancelled altogether.","Naga and Corser completed the podium line-up.","After a one-year hiatus, the Le

Hockenheimring Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (German: [\u02c8h\u0254kn\u0329ha\u026am\u0281\u026a\u014b \u02ccba\u02d0dn\u0329 \u02c8v\u028f\u0281t\u0259mb\u025b\u0281k] (listen)) is a motor racing circuit situated in the Rhine valley near the town of Hockenheim in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany, located on the Bertha Benz Memorial Route.","Amongst other motor racing events, it has hosted the German Grand Prix, most recently in 2019.","The circuit has very little differences in elevation.","The circuit has an FIA Grade 1 license.","Originally called \"Dreieckskurs\" (triangle course), the Hockenheimring was built in 1932.","The man behind it is Ernst Christ, a young timekeeper who felt that a racing track should be built in his hometown of Hockenheim.","He submitted the plans to the mayor and they were approved on Christmas day, in 1931.This first layout of the track was around twelve kilometres long and consisted of a large triangle-like section, a hairpin in the city and two straights connecting them.","In 1938, the circuit dramatically shortened, from twelve kilometres down to just over seven and a half, and the Ostkurve corner, which lasted until 2001, was introduced for the first time.","In that year, the track was also renamed to \"Kurpfalzring\".","The track was damaged by tanks during World War II.","After the war, the track was repaired, and renamed to \"Hockenheimring\".","Former DKW and NSU factory rider and world record setter Wilhelm Herz became the manager of the track in 1954 and promoted the track successfully; Grand Prix motorcycle racing events were held, with the German motorcycle Grand Prix alternating between the Hockenheimring and other tracks.","This version of the circuit was just over seven and a half kilometres long and consisted of the original two long straights, with the Ostkurve in the forest and the original hairpin inside Hockenheim joining them together.","In 1965, when the new Autobahn A 6 separated the village from the main part of the track, a new version of Hockenheim circuit was built, with the \"Motodrom\" stadium section, designed by John Hugenholtz, who also designed Suzuka.","After Jim Clark was killed on 7 April 1968 in a Formula 2 racing accident, two fast chicanes were added and the track was lined with crash barriers in 1970.","A small memorial was placed near the first chicane (which was named after him), at the site of his accident.","In 1982, another chicane was added at the Ostkurve (east curve), after Patrick Depailler was killed there in 1980, and the first chicane was made slower as well.","For the 1992 German Grand Prix, the Ostkurve was changed yet again, from a quick left turn into a more complex right-left-right chicane, after \u00c9rik Comas crashed there in 1991.","The second chicane was renamed after Ayrton Senna, after his death at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.","This version used to be quite large, with a very long and very fast section going through forests essentially consisting of four straights of roughly 1.3km, separated by a chicane sequence, followed by a more tight and twisty \"stadium\" section (so called because of all the grandstands situated there) named Motodrom.","This made the setting up of racing cars difficult, since a choice had to be made\u2013 whether to run low downforce to optimize speed through the straights and compromise grip in the stadium section, or vice versa.","The long track length also meant that a typical Formula One race had only 45 laps, limiting the spectators' experience of the race to only that many passes through the stadium.","During the mid-1980s \"turbo era\" of Formula One where fuel was restricted to either 220 (1984\u201385), 195 (1986\u201387) or 150 (1988) litres for races for the turbo powered cars, Hockenheim also saw drivers, including World Champion Alain Prost, at times fail to finish due to simply running out of fuel near the end of the race.","Prost ran out at the end of the 1986 race, pushing his McLaren towards the line before giving up.","He was placed 3rd when he ran dry and was eventually classified 6th, gaining a valuable championship point that would help him with his second World Championship.","Many problems came to light during the 2000 German Grand Prix, which was won by Brazilian driver Rubens Barrichello from having started 18th on the grid.","The race finished in changeable weather conditions, with pouring rain in the stadium sector and almost completely dry forest straights.","All the overtaking moves that took place during the race were in the chicanes of the forest sector, meaning hardly any spectators saw most of the best action.","Midway through the race, a former Mercedes-Benz employee, who had been dismissed, breached the track's security barriers on the first forest straight, showing vulnerable security facilities in the forest and leading to the deployment of the safety car that neutralized a comfortable lead for the two Mercedes-powered McLarens.","Later on, French driver Jean Alesi collided with Brazilian Pedro Diniz in the braking zone for the third chicane and his car spun uncontrollably down the track, which caused him to suffer dizziness for three days.","These events prompted much protest from the FIA to greatly improve spectator viewing, safety, and security at the track, claiming that the track was no longer suited to modern Formula One racing.","In the early 2000s, F1 officials demanded the 6.823km (4.240mi) track be shortened and threatened to discontinue racing there, threatening to relocate to other tracks such as the EuroSpeedway Lausitz and sites in Asia.","The state government of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg secured the financing for the redesign by Hermann Tilke for the 2002 German Grand Prix.","The stadium section remained mostly intact, despite a new surface and a tighter Turn 1 (\"Nordkurve\").","However, the circuit was dramatically shortened, with the long, forested straights section chopped off in favour of more tight corners.","More than half of the first straight and almost all of the straight between the Ostkurve and Senna chicane were cut and the rest was connected with a new long straight called the \"Parabolika\", with a small kink being added between the first straight and the new one.","A small right-left-right complex was added to the remaining part of the final straight, with a new grandstand overlooking it.","In an extremely controversial move, the old forest section was torn up and replanted with trees, eliminating any chance of using the old course either for future F1 events or for historic car events.","There was and still remains a great deal of criticism of the track redesign, in terms of ruining the previous unique technical challenges of the old Hockenheim circuit and delivering a new homogenised \"assembly line\" circuit without the character of the previous layout, whilst being beset by the perceived problems of other Tilke circuits.","Several drivers and team principals, including Ron Dennis, Jarno Trulli and Juan Pablo Montoya, criticised the changes and stated their preference for the old circuit.","The change in the track layout also saw the installation of a new memorial to Jim Clark.","This is located at the outside of the current track's turn 2, where the old track continued out into the forests, and the new shortened track turns to the right.","The new track has a seating capacity of 120,000, due to new large grandstands sponsored by Mercedes-Benz.","The complex also features a quarter-mile track for drag racing.","It hosts one of the largest drag racing events in Europe, known as the NitrOlympx, and was one of the last Top Fuel circuits to race to 0.25 miles (400m) before the FIA switched the nitro categories to the now-recognised 1,000 feet (300m) distance in 2012.","The Hockenheim Circuit hosted the German Grand Prix for the first time in 1970 when the F1 drivers decided at the French Grand Prix to boycott the allegedly dangerous N\u00fcrburgring unless major changes were made.","The next year the German Grand Prix went back to the N\u00fcrburgring until the 1976 German Grand Prix.","From 1977 to 2006, the Hockenheimring hosted the German Grand Prix with the exception of 1985, when the race was held at the reconfigured N\u00fcrburgring.","In July 2006, Bernie Ecclestone announced that from 2007 onwards, there would be only one Grand Prix per year in Germany.","Since 1995, there had been two Grands Prix every year in Germany; the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, plus either the European Grand Prix or the Luxembourg Grand Prix at the N\u00fcrburgring.","From 2007, the N\u00fcrburgring and Hockenheimring alternated hosting the German Grand Prix, starting with the N\u00fcrburgring in 2007.","Ongoing deficits of the Formula One races, amounting to up to 5.3 million Euro per race that had to be covered by the local communities, made it likely the contract between the Hockenheimring and Formula One Management would not be extended after the Grand Prix of 2010.","However, in October 2009 the contract for the circuit to hold the German GP was extended to 2018, with the FOA agreeing to cover any losses the event incurs.","Neither Hockenheim nor the N\u00fcrburgring hosted a Grand Prix in 2015 or 2017 after the N\u00fcrburgring failed to complete an agreement with Formula 1's commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone.","From 1986 to 1988, the start\u2013finish straight was used for 1\/8 mile drag racing.","In 1989, a proper drag strip was built by connecting the Opel-Kurve and the first turn entering the Motodrom section.","The finish line was at the beginning of the forest, with a very long run-off on the straight in the forest.","Competitors had to travel around the full race track in opposite direction to return to the paddock.","The drag strip is only used for two events in August, the Public Race Days and the NitrolympX[de] main event a week later.","Originally named the Nitrolympics and featuring Top Fuel dragsters, it was renamed to NitrolympX.","When the Hockenheimring was shortened in 2002, the drag strip was moved back, closer to the new tall Tower stands that allow an unusual view along the drag strip.","Even though the run off was cut in half it remains one of the longest in drag racing.","The NitrolympX usually host most European Drag Racing Championship, sanctioned by FIA or FIM, plus jet dragsters and other entertaining events on the Saturday night show that draws 40,000 spectators.","The drag strip in 2008 was christened Rico Anthes Quartermile after the German former Top Fuel driver and long-time organizer of the NitrolympX had retired in 2007.","As the dragstrip can only be prepared for professional drag racing after the last major circuit event, mainly the Formula One race, the grip is often sub par compared to permanent drag strips that host two Euro Championship events each year, like Santa Pod Raceway in England or Tierp Arena in Sweden.","The best performances on the full quarter-mile were significantly below those in Santa Pod, and the best ET was set in 2005: 4.873 sec.","and 458km\/h by Brady Kalivoda (USA).","In 2012, some Pro classes could not find traction as Formula One had demanded a new surface.","In subsequent years, the organizers provided a better track, with support from Santa Pod personnel and machinery.","In 2016, Hockenheim, and mainland Europe, finally saw the first 3-second Top Fuel 1000ft passes, with 3.939 sec.","and 486.91km\/h by Anita M\u00e4kel\u00e4 (FIN).","An overall European record for Super Street Bike was set by Garry Bowe (GB) with 7.04s 340,69km\/h.","The DTM (Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters) series has regularly raced at the Hockenheimring since its revival in 2000.","In most years, the DTM has competed there twice during a season.","Located in the stadia section of the track, the rallycross track uses a section of track from turns 11 to 16, combined with a dirt section in front of the grandstands.","It hosted first ever World RX of Hockenheim, round 2 of FIA World Rallycross Championship in 2015 as supporting event of DTM.","WRX also combined with the DTM for an event there in 2017."]},{"category":"Circuit","circuitId":11,"name":"Hungaroring","location":"Budapest","country":"Hungary","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hungaroring","circuit_text":["The Hungaroring is a motorsport racetrack in Mogyor\u00f3d, Hungary where the Formula One Hungarian Grand Prix is held.","In 1986, it became the location of the first Formula One Grand Prix behind the Iron Curtain.","Bernie Ecclestone wanted a race in the USSR, but a Hungarian friend recommended Budapest.","They wanted a street circuit similar to the Circuit de Monaco to be built in the N\u00e9pliget \u2013 Budapest's largest park \u2013 but the government decided to build a new circuit just outside the city near a major highway.","Construction works started on 1 October 1985.","It was built in eight months, less time than any other Formula One circuit.","The first race was held on 24 March 1986, in memory of J\u00e1nos Drap\u00e1l, the first Hungarian who won motorcycle Grand Prix races.","According to a survey put together by the national tourism office of Hungary, Mogyor\u00f3d ranks third among Hungarian destinations visited by tourists, behind the Danube Bend area and Lake Balaton, but ahead of Budapest.","The circuit has FIA Grade 1 license.","The Grand Prix is held in the middle of summer, which is usually extremely hot and dry in this region.","Its first wet Grand Prix race was in 2006.","The circuit is normally dusty due to underuse throughout the rest of the year and its sandy soil.","As the circuit is in a valley about 80 percent of it can be seen from any point.","Normally, an underused circuit becomes faster over the weekend as the track surface gathers more rubber residue; however, with the Hungaroring this generally does not happen, because the track can get dusty so quickly.","The track frequently becomes faster during a qualifying session, which leads competitors to try for their best lap as late as possible.","The twisty and bumpy nature of the circuit makes overtaking very difficult in dry conditions, the circuit is nicknamed \"Monaco without the buildings\" for this reason.","Nonetheless, the Hungaroring has been the scene of several memorable races such as the duels of Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna, Nigel Mansell's win from 12th on the grid after a dramatic pass on Ayrton Senna in 1989, Damon Hill's almost victory with Arrows in 1997, and Michael Schumacher's change in strategy to beat the McLarens of H\u00e4kkinen and Coulthard in 1998.","More recently, it has seen events such as Jenson Button triumphing over Fernando Alonso in the wet in 2006, Daniel Ricciardo scything through the field from sixth on the grid in 2014, Lewis Hamilton's late overtake on Max Verstappen to take the win in 2019, and Alonso producing a defensive masterclass to deny Hamilton a chance of victory in 2021.","Maiden wins at the track include Hill in 1993, Alonso in 2003, Button in 2006, Heikki Kovalainen in 2008, and Esteban Ocon in 2021.","The first change in the track's layout was carried out in 1989, when the chicane after the actual turn three (a temporary measure put in during construction due to the discovery of a spring where the direct route was due to run) was removed by culverting the stream.","In 2003, the main straight (turn one, see diagram) was lengthened by roughly 200m (660ft) to 908 m, and the hairpin at the end of the straight was also tightened in an attempt to facilitate more overtaking opportunities, as well as a tightening of what was turn 12.","Hungaroring has crowned two drivers in its 20-year history: both Nigel Mansell in 1992 and Michael Schumacher in 2001 were able to win the World Championship title.","Moreover, the WilliamsF1 Team and Scuderia Ferrari also secured the Constructors' Championship at the Hungaroring, Williams in 1996 and Ferrari in 2001, 2002, and 2004.","Both Hungary's Zsolt Baumgartner and Poland's Robert Kubica made their debut on this track as the first F1 drivers of their countries.","The 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix was the first wet grand prix at the Hungaroring.","This saw the retirement of many drivers including championship rivals Fernando Alonso and Michael Schumacher and gave Jenson Button and the reborn Honda F1 team their first win.","Fernando Alonso also earned his first Grand Prix victory at this in 2003, declaring it his favourite track as a result.","According to statements and interviews, drivers have different opinions on the track.","While many, like Ayrton Senna, Nigel Mansell, Michael Schumacher, Lewis Hamilton, Max Verstappen and Fernando Alonso claimed to love it, many others consider the track too slow, hot and demanding.The technical driving center of the Hungaroring held former racer Gerhard Berger's name from 1998 until 2005 but later it was changed to Allianz.","The track also has named curves: Turn 4 is named after Nigel Mansell, due to him losing a wheel there during the 1987 Hungarian Grand Prix.","Turn 11 is named after Jean Alesi following his massive crash there during qualifying for the 1995 Hungarian Grand Prix.","On Saturday, 25 July 2009, in the second round of qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix at Hungaroring, Ferrari driver Felipe Massa's head was injured, though protected by his driver's helmet, he was struck by a suspension spring that had fallen from Rubens Barrichello's Brawn GP car while driving at high speed.","He was knocked unconscious, and subsequently crashed head-on into a tyre barrier.","Massa was thereafter airlifted to the military hospital in Budapest, where he underwent surgery in the area surrounding his left eye.","His condition was initially described as \"life-threatening but stable\", but improved rapidly.","Massa was discharged from hospital the following week and returned to Brazil.","After further tests it was decided that Massa needed a titanium plate inserted into his skull to strengthen it for racing in Formula One again.","While most of the foreign fans are from Germany and Austria, the Hungaroring has traditionally seen a large influx of Finnish fans as well.","With the loss of the Austrian Grand Prix in 2003,

Val\u00e8ncia, Spanish: Circuito Urbano de Valencia) was a street circuit in Valencia, Spain which hosted the Formula One European Grand Prix for five years (2008\u20132012).","The first race meeting on the circuit was held over the 23\/24 August 2008 weekend, with Felipe Massa winning the main event, the European Grand Prix, after starting from pole position.","The circuit used the roads skirting the city's harbour and America's Cup port area \u2013 including a section over a 140-metre-long (460ft) swing bridge \u2013 and also included some roads designed exclusively for racing purposes by the German architect Hermann Tilke, who also designed the infrastructure buildings for the circuit.","The 2012 edition took place on 24 June and was the last to go under the name of the European Grand Prix until 2016, when the Baku City Circuit used the title for one year.","It has not been used since 2013 after a deal fell through to alternate this venue with Catalunya in Barcelona to host the Spanish Grand Prix.","The deal to host the Valencia race was signed on 1 June 2007, and was for seven years.","The deal was made between Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone and the Valmor Sport group, led by former motorcycle rider Jorge Martinez Aspar and Villarreal football club's president Fernando Roig.","The deal came about despite Ecclestone previously stating that no European country should hold more than one race each year, as there was already a Spanish Grand Prix at the Circuit de Catalunya.","Initially, the deal was rumoured to be conditional on the People's Party winning regional elections on 27 May 2007.","On 16 May, Ecclestone clarified his comments, explaining \"I said I wouldn't formalise a contract until after the elections because I didn't know who I would be signing it with\" and claiming his earlier statements had been taken out of concircuit_text.","Ecclestone was later cleared of influencing the election by the Valencian Electoral Commission.","The official track layout was unveiled by Valencia Councillor and transport counselor, Mario Flores, on 19 July 2007.","The track was first used in the last weekend of July 2008, as the circuit hosted a round of the Spanish F3 Championship and International GT Open.","It was first used for the European Grand Prix on 24 August 2008.","The track was 5.419 kilometres (3.367mi) long and incorporated a total of 25 turns \u2013 11 left-handers and 14 right-handers.","It was estimated that the track had a top speed of around 323 kilometres per hour (201mph), with a lap record of 1:38.683, set by Timo Glock during the 2009 European Grand Prix.","Valencia was not as tight as Circuit de Monaco but overtaking opportunities were still scarce, due to the straights not being straight and the dust away from the racing line.","Nico H\u00fclkenberg noted there was quite a lot of space for a street circuit, and some corners had a lot of run-off area; Robert Kubica suggested that good traction and braking stability were crucial to win at the circuit, due to the number of long straights that ended in heavy braking zones.","The circuit was criticised by drivers for its lack of overtaking opportunities.","Changes in Formula One in 2011, including the introduction of the Drag Reduction System and the switch to Pirelli tyres, partially improved that with 27 passes recorded in that year's race, 22 of which were accredited to the assistance of DRS.","However, the five 'normal' overtakes still represented the year's second lowest total, although the adoption of two DRS zones for that year's race limited the potential for non-DRS assisted passes.","Despite this, the 2012 race was shown to have many different overtakes and became one of the most thrilling races of the season.","It also had many more retirements \u2013 a total in four in 2012 compared to zero retirements during the 2011 race.","The pit straight is short and immediately leads into the flat-out turn 1 before cars heavily brake down to 60mph (95km\/h) for the right-left complex of turns 2 and 3, passing the Grau Metro station.","A curved 'straight' leads into a left-right chicane: turns 4 and 5, by the Neptune Hotel.","Drivers exit the 85mph (135km\/h) chicane by running very close to the wall, before sweeping through the kinks of turns 6 and 7, then braking heavily for the following swing bridge section.","One of the slowest corners on the track, turn 8, with an apex speed of around 55mph (90km\/h), leads drivers over the bridge before immediately braking again into the equally slow turn 10.","Good traction is important out of here as the following section is a DRS zone with a top speed along the kinked 'straight' of around 200mph (320km\/h), with a heavy braking zone for the 90mph (145km\/h) turn 12\/13 chicane; a 2nd-gear, right-left complex.","Turn 14 is a medium speed right-hander before another, shorter DRS zone that leads through two left-hand kinks before the turn 17 hairpin at Museu de les Ci\u00e8ncies Pr\u00edncipe Felipe.","Right-handed and a good spot for overtaking, turn 17 is taken at about 60mph (95km\/h).","A series of flat-out, or near flat-out sweeping curves follow, with the right-handers of turns 19 and 20 the most challenging of the bunch.","Turn 25 is a hairpin, taken at about 60mph (95km\/h); the run to the line following this left-hander is fairly short but requires good traction and acceleration for the best lap time."]},{"category":"Circuit","circuitId":13,"name":"Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps","location":"Spa","country":"Belgium","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Circuit_de_Spa-Francorchamps","circuit_text":["The Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps (French pronunciation:\u200b[si\u0281k\u0265i d\u0259 spa f\u0281\u0251\u0303k\u0254\u0281\u0283\u0251\u0303]), frequently referred to as Spa, is a 7.004km (4.352mi) motor-racing circuit located in Stavelot, Belgium.","It is the current venue of the Formula One Belgian Grand Prix, hosting its first Grand Prix in 1925, and has held a Grand Prix every year since 1985 (except 2003 and 2006).","Spa also hosts several other international events including the 24 Hours of Spa, the World Endurance Championship 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, and the TCR Spa 500.","It is also home to the Uniroyal Fun Cup 25 Hours of Spa, one of the longest motor races in the world.","The circuit has undergone several redesigns through its history, most extensively in 1979 when the track was modified and shortened from a 14.100km (8.761mi) circuit using public roads to a 6.968km (4.330mi) permanent circuit due to safety concerns with the old circuit.","Despite its name, the circuit is not in Spa but lies in the vicinity of the town of Francorchamps within the boundaries of the municipality of Stavelot, with a part in the boundaries of Malmedy.","Designed in 1920 by Jules de Thier and Henri Langlois Van Ophem, the original course used public roads linking the Belgian towns of Francorchamps, Malmedy, and Stavelot.","The track's inaugural race was planned for August 1921, but was cancelled when only one driver entered.","The first car race was held at the circuit in 1922, and 1924 saw the first running of the now famous 24 Hours of Francorchamps race.","The circuit was first used for Grand Prix racing in 1925.","The original Spa-Francorchamps circuit was essentially a speed course, with drivers managing higher average speeds than on other race tracks.","At the time, the Belgians took pride in having a very fast circuit, and to improve average speeds, in 1939 the former slow uphill U-turn at the bottom of the Eau Rouge creek valley, called the Ancienne Douane (until 1920, there was a German Empire customs office here), was cut short with a faster sweep straight up the hill, called the Raidillon.","At Eau Rouge, southbound traffic was allowed to use the famous uphill corner, while the opposite downhill traffic had to use the old road and U-turn behind the grandstands, rejoining the race track at the bottom of Eau Rouge.","The old race track continued through the now-straightened Kemmel curves to the highest part of the track (104 metres above the lowest part), then went downhill into Les Combes, a fast, slightly banked downhill left-hand corner towards Burnenville, passing this village in a fast right hand sweep.","Near Malmedy, the Masta straight began, which was only interrupted by the Masta Kink between farm houses before arriving at the town of Stavelot.","Then, the track progressed through an uphill straight section with a few bends called La Carriere, going through two high-speed turns (the former being an unnamed right-hand turn, and the latter named Blanchimont) before braking very hard for the La Source hairpin, and that rejoined the downhill start finish section (as opposed to today where the start\u2013finish section is before La Source).","Spa is located in the Belgian Ardennes countryside, and the old circuit was, and still is, used as everyday public road, and there were houses, trees, electric poles, fields and other obstacles located right next to the track.","Before 1970, there were no safety modifications of any kind done to the circuit and the conditions of the circuit were, aside from a few straw bales, virtually identical to everyday civilian use.","Former Formula One racing driver and team owner Jackie Oliver was quoted as saying \"if you went off the road, you didn't know what you were going to hit\".","Spa-Francorchamps was the fastest road circuit in Europe at the time, and it had a reputation for being dangerous and very fast \u2013 it demanded calmness from drivers, and most were frightened of it.","The old Spa circuit was unique in that speeds were consistently high with hardly any let-up at all for three to four minutes.","This made it an extraordinarily difficult mental challenge, because most of the corners were taken at more than 180 miles per hour (290km\/h) and were not quite flat \u2013 every corner was as important as the one before it.","If a driver lifted the throttle more than expected, then whole seconds, not tenths, would be lost.","The slightest error of any kind carried multiple harsh consequences, but this also worked inversely: huge advantages could be gained if a driver came out of a corner slightly faster.","Like the Le Mans circuit, which also ran on public roads, Spa became notorious for fatal accidents.","At the 1960 Belgian Grand Prix, two drivers, Chris Bristow and Alan Stacey, were killed within 15 minutes (although Stacey's accident was caused by a bird hitting him in the face) and Stirling Moss had crashed at Burnenville during practice and was severely injured.","When Armco crash barriers were added to the track in 1970, deaths became less frequent, but the track was still notorious for other factors.","The Ardennes forest had very unpredictable weather and there were parts where it was raining and the track was wet, and other parts where the sun was shining and the track was completely dry.","This factor was a commonality on long circuits, but the unpredictable weather at Spa, combined with the fact that it was a track with all but one corner being high-speed, made it one of the most dangerous race tracks in the world (if not the most).","As a result, the Formula 1 and motorcycle Grands Prix and 1000km sportscar races saw smaller than usual fields at Spa because most drivers and riders feared the circuit and did not like racing there.","Multiple fatalities during the 1973 and 1975 24 Hours of Spa touring car races more or less sealed the old circuit's fate, and by 1978, the last year Spa was in its original form, the only major races held there were the Belgian motorcycle Grand Prix and the Spa 24 Hours touring car race; the 1000km World Sportscar Championship race no longer took place after 1975 and did not come back until 1982.","In 1969, the Belgian Grand Prix was boycotted by the F1 drivers because of the extreme danger of Spa.","There had been ten car racing fatalities in total at the track in the 1960s, including five in the two years previous.","The drivers demanded changes made to Spa which were not possible on short notice, so the Belgian Grand Prix was dropped that year.","Armco barriers were added to the track and sections of it were improved (especially the Stavelot and Holowell sections), just like they had been added for the 1969 Le Mans race.","One last race there the following year on the improved track was still not satisfactory enough (even after a temporary chicane was added at Malmedy just for that race) for the drivers in terms of safety, and even with the chicane, the drivers averaged over 150mph (241km\/h) during the race.","For the 1971 race, the track owners and authorities had not brought the track up to date with mandatory safety measures, and the race was cancelled.","Formula One would not return to Spa until 1983 on the modern track.","The Masta Kink \"was by far the most difficult corner in the world\", according to Jackie Stewart, requiring skill and bravery in equal measure to get it right.","After a long run from Malmedy, the cars would reach top speed before having to negotiate Masta, a high speed left-right chicane, and a good exit speed was vital as it was followed by another long straight run to Stavelot.","This was a very fast and very dangerous corner, as it was situated right in the middle of two long unbroken straights, both about 1.5mi (2.4km) long.","The speed in this sector could reach 190mph (306km\/h).","Masta was removed from F1 racing after the 1970 season.","Jackie Stewart's crusade to improve safety in racing was set in motion by his crash there in 1966, when his BRM ended upside-down in a ditch near a farmhouse on the outside of the corner, with fuel gushing out of the tank onto Stewart, who had broken ribs.","At this point, many of the Formula One drivers disliked Spa (including Stewart and Jim Clark, who had some of his greatest wins there) because of the immense speeds that were constant on the track.","While he was spectating at the 1972 12 Hours of Sebring, Stewart attempted to organise a boycott of the Spa 1000km race that year, a move that was not respected by many of the drivers, because Spa was still popular with racing drivers outside of Formula One.","Stewart later described the old Spa circuit in 1986 as being as \"ferocious as a tiger\", and he later described Masta in an interview in 2011 as perhaps the hardest corner on any racetrack he raced on in his career; even more so than Eau Rouge.","Another particularly gruesome story comes from the 1972 24-hour touring car race.","During one of his pit stops at night, Hans-Joachim Stuck shouted to his co-driver Jochen Mass over the noise from the cars that he should \"look out for body parts at the Masta Kink\".","Mass arrived there expecting to see pieces from cars all over the road but was appalled to discover it was in fact the remains of a marshal.","After Masta, and at the end of the subsequent Holowell Straight, there used to be a sharp hairpin at the entrance to the town itself, which was later bypassed by a quicker, banked right hand corner.","Another fast section of road in the forest leads to Blanchimont.","Here, the new short Grand Prix track of 1979 joins the old layout.","Eighteen Formula One World Championship Grands Prix were run on the Spa-Francorchamps circuit's original configuration, which was boycotted by F1 in 1969, before the revised circuit banished it to the history books in 1979.","The lap record of the old triangle-shaped track is 3 minutes and 13.4 seconds, held by the French driver Henri Pescarolo, driving a Matra at the 1973 Spa 1000km World Sportscar Championship race at an average speed of 262 kilometres per hour (163mph), but the fastest ever recorded time of the old Spa circuit was the pole position time for the same race\u20143 minutes and 12.7 seconds by Jacky Ickx in a Ferrari 312PB.","Over the years, the Spa course has been modified several times.","The track was originally 15 kilometres (9mi) long, but after World War II, the track underwent some changes.","In 1930, the chicane at Malmedy was eliminated and bypassed, making the course even faster, but the chicane was re-installed in 1935, albeit slightly different.","In 1939, \"Virage de l'Ancienne Douane\" was eliminated and cut short, thus giving birth to the Eau Rouge\/Raidillon uphill sweeping corner.","In 1947, the chicane at Malmedy was again eliminated and bypassed, and was made part of the Masta Straight.","The slight right-hander that was originally Holowell (the corner before Stavelot after the second Masta Straight) was eliminated.","And finally, instead of going through a slight left-hander that went into the town of Stavelot and a sharp right-hander at a road junction in Stavelot, a shortcut was built that became a very fast, very wide right-handed turn that bypassed Stavelot.","All these changes made the final configuration of the old Spa circuit 14km (9mi) long, and also made Spa the fastest open road circuit in the world.","In the final years of the old circuit, drivers could average 150mph (241km\/h).","The biggest change, however, saw the circuit being shortened from 14km (9mi) to 7km (4mi) in 1979.","The start\/finish line, which was originally on the downhill straight before Eau Rouge, was moved to the straight before the La Source hairpin in 1981.","Like its predecessor, the new layout is still a fast and hilly route through the Ardennes where speeds in excess of 330km\/h (205mph) can be reached.","Since its inception, the place has been famous for its unpredictable weather, where drivers are confronted with one part of the course being clear and bright while another stretch is rainy and slippery.","The circuit probably demonstrates the importance of driver skill more than any other in the world.","This is largely due to the Eau Rouge and Blanchimont corners, both which need to be taken flat out to achieve a fast run onto the straights after them, which aids a driver in both a fast lap and in overtaking.","The most famous part of the circuit is the Eau Rouge and Raidillon combination.","Having negotiated the La Source hairpin, drivers race down a straight to the point where the track crosses the Eau Rouge stream for the first time, before being launched steeply uphill into a sweeping left-right-left series of corners with a blind summit.","Properly speaking, the Eau Rouge corner is only the left-hander at the bottom.","The following right-hander that leads steeply uphill, which was introduced in 1939 to shortcut the original Ancienne Douane hairpin, is called Raidillon.","The corner requires an amount of skill from the driver to negotiate it well and the long Kemmel straight ahead produces good overtaking opportunities for drivers at the following \"Les Combes\" corner.","The corner was tighter and narrower before 1970, allowing drivers to take the corner faster.","A challenge for drivers has always been to take Eau Rouge\/Raidillon flat out.","Touring cars can take the corner at 160\u2013180km\/h (99\u2013112mph), and Formula One cars at over 300km\/h (186mph) due to high downforce.","World Champion Jacques Villeneuve once spoke of the effects of downforce, saying that to get through the corner the drivers have to drive faster, because downforce increases the faster a race car goes.","Without lifting the throttle through Eau Rouge, a car would be flat out from La Source, along the Kemmel straight to Les Combes, a total distance of 2.015km.","A loss of control through this section can often lead to a very heavy shunt, as usually the rear end of the car is lost and the resulting impact is often lateral.","Several famous racing drivers have crashed while driving through Eau Rouge\/Radillon, including Stefan Bellof in a Porsche sportscar, Guy Renard during the 1990 24h of Spa-Francorchamps in a Toyota Corolla GT, and Alex Zanardi in a season-ending crash during a practice session of the 1993 Belgian Grand Prix in a Lotus.","Jacques Villeneuve suffered a spectacular crash at the top of Radillon in qualifying during the 1999 Belgian Grand Prix which he described as \"My best-ever crash\".","His teammate Ricardo Zonta followed Villeneuve by having a similar accident later in practice, leading cartoonist Jim Bamber to show BAR boss Craig Pollock telling Zonta: \"Jacques is the quickest through Eau Rouge, so go out there and do exactly what Jacques does\u2026\" It was revealed later that Villeneuve and Zonta had a personal bet to see if either could take the corner flat out.","Following the deaths of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna at Imola in 1994, the following F1 races saw the introduction of chicanes made up from stacked tyres.","The entry to Eau Rouge was obstructed in such a way in 1994, although it was returned to its previous configuration the following year.","The corner was slightly modified for the 2002 Belgian Grand Prix.","When fans first got to see the course configuration at the start of the weekend of the 2005 Turkish Grand Prix, they noted that an uphill kink on the back straight was very similar to Eau Rouge; the kink was therefore jokingly dubbed \"Faux Rouge\" (a pun on the name of the original Spa corner using the French word \"faux\", meaning \"false\").","The Blanchimont high-speed left-hand turn, present in both the old 14km circuit and the new, shorter, 7km track, is the final sweeping corner of the track before the chicane, which leads to the pit straight.","This turn and the approach to it have been the scene of serious accidents over time, the most recent being in 2001, when Luciano Burti lost the front wing of his Prost due to a clash with Eddie Irvine's Jaguar, losing front downforce and steering, leaving the track at 298km\/h (185mph) and piling into the tyre wall, the impact knocking him out and burying the car into a mound of tyres.","Problems have also occurred in lower classes of racing with Tom Kristensen having a very violent crash in a Formula 3000 car in 1997 after running wide on the entry to the Blanchimont turn and subsequently hitting the wall, throwing the monocoque back out in the middle of the track, where it was hit by numerous cars before coming to a complete halt.","The run-off area is narrower than in other turns taken at this speed, and behind the protective barriers there is a 7\u20138 metre drop.","This is the first turn taken by the cars after the new track rejoins the route of the old 14km track.","Blanchimont was also the scene where in 1992 after \u00c9rik Comas had crashed heavily during Friday's session, Ayrton Senna stopped, disembarked his car and sprinted to help the injured driver, with other cars driving past at racing speeds.","From the 2018 Belgian Grand Prix turn 11 has been called the Jacky Ickx corner as a tribute to his career.","The corner was formerly known by most drivers as \"speakers corner\".","This is where the announcer of the race could see the cars after they disappeared into the forest after Raidillon.","Due to the introduction of the Television Without Frontiers Directive (1989), tobacco advertising and sponsorship on television were banned within the European Union from 1991.","Formula One faced a major threat regarding races in its historical European heartland.","Due to these political and legislative circumstances, the Grand Prix at Spa was left out of the 2003 calendar as a response to the internal tobacco legislation in Belgium.","The event was tagged as a world class event within the national senate, and thus it was saved for the 2004 Formula One season.","The final Bus Stop chicane was reprofiled for 2004 with an additional sweep to the right.","Spa was dropped from the Formula One calendar in 2006.","The organiser of the event went bankrupt in late 2005, and therefore the planned improvements to the race track and paddock had not yet been made.","The Wallonia government stepped in and provided the necessary funds, but too late for the 2006 race to take place.","With a new financial backer, the renovation started on 6 November 2006 and finished in May 2007, costing around \u20ac19 million.","Formula 1 returned to Spa for 2007, with a modified track layout.","The Bus Stop chicane was moved back towards Blanchimont and the La Source hairpin moved forward.","This allowed more space for the new pit lane, and gave a longer start\/finish straight.","New asphalt runoff was added to the inside and outside of Les Combes for the 2010 race, in line with the prevailing trends at other Formula One circuits.","Prior to the 2013 race, drainage grooves were cut into the asphalt on the start\u2013finish straight, underneath the first 11 grid slots.","Drivers were initially concerned that this would affect grip at the start.","In Spa Francorchamps' tenure as a permanent racing facility, after it was removed from the public road network in 2000, there have been multiple accidents in the Eau Rouge\/Raidillon combination.","In the day and age where safety is paramount to many racing organizations and governing bodies like the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile, these crashes, of which some noteworthy ones are listed below, did open up public debate whether the Eau Rouge\/Raidillon combination was deemed unsafe.","In October 2020 the circuit announced that gravel traps would be placed at La Source, Raidillon, Blanchimont, Les Combes and Stavelot.","The runoff areas of some corners including Raidillon would be expanded.","It was part of an \u20ac80 million upgrade to the circuit that would make it able to hold motorcycle races.","The upgrade also include a grandstand at the top of the Eau Rouge\/Raidillon hill.","During the Formula 2 feature race in late August, a serious incident between Anthoine Hubert and Juan Manuel Correa occurred shortly after Raidillon on the Kemmel Straight.","As the second lap began, Trident driver Giuliano Alesi lost control of his car as he climbed the Raidillon curve due to a puncture he had received earlier, causing his car to spin and hit the left wall of the circuit, tearing off his rear wing and spreading debris onto the track.","As another Trident driver, Ralph Boschung reached the crest of Raidillon, he slowed down and moved towards the run-off area to avoid Alesi's damaged car and the field of debris.","Hubert, who was following Boschung closely and had no view of what had happened to Alesi, moved right to avoid Boschung's slowing car, clipping Boschung's right rear wheel with his front wing.","Hubert's car crashed into the tyre barrier on the right side of the track at an acute angle and was deflected sideways into the path of Charouz driver Juan Manuel Correa, who struck it on the left side in the driver seat area.","The incident resulted in the death of Hubert and serious injury to Correa with the feature race being abandoned and the scheduled sprint race a day later being cancelled too, whilst the Formula 1 Belgian Grand Prix went ahead.","During the qualifying session of the W Series, rain started to fall, affecting the grip.","This caused a serious incident that involved six cars crashing into each other.","Sarah Moore was the first driver to lose control of her car, spinning into the barrier at Raidillon.","Abbie Eaton also lost the car and spun into the same barrier.","She bounced back into Moore at low speed.","Beitske Visser was the next driver to lose the rear end.","She spun around and went straight into Eaton and Moore, causing Eaton to go airbound.","Ayla Agren did the same as Visser, spinning around and running into Moore and an airbourne Eaton.","Bel\u00e9n Garc\u00eda then hit all four cars, causing Visser to go airbourne and mount the tyre barrier.","The final car of Fabienne Wohlwend then came in and hit Beitske Visser head on, causing Visser to spin into the track and roll over.","The incident ended with cars all over the track and run off.","All drivers were checked as a precaution, and Visser and Agren were sent to hospital for x-rays and further checks.","Eventually, all drivers were cleared and unharmed.","This incident caused more debate online as to whether the corner was safe and if the runoff was too short.","Many believed that since the tyre barrier bounces cars back onto the track, it is unsafe and should be changed.","The previously mentioned changes, announced in October 2020, were still to be installed.","Just one day after the W Series crash, Formula One held its qualifying session in heavy rain.","In the third segment of qualifying, many drivers were complaining that the conditions were not safe and that the session should be delayed or red flagged.","Lando Norris then had a very big snap of oversteer, and subsequently corrected but then aquaplaned into the tyre barrier at Raidillon.","His McLaren then spun around five times while crossing the track in a dangerous manner.","Norris was taken to hospital for x-rays, but was cleared to race the next day.","After this crash and the W Series incident just a day before, drivers from all series were calling for changes to that section of the track.","Jack Aitken, who a month earlier suffered a broken collarbone and fractured vertebra after a crash at Eau Rouge in the 2021 24 Hours of Spa, said \"everyone has gotten the picture of what needs changing\" on social media, regarding the W Series crash.","Guanyu Zhou stated \"Eau Rouge corner in Spa needs to making a change,\" while Pietro Fittipaldi said \"they need to do something to Eau Rouge to make it safer.\u201d Carlos Sainz Jr. insisted the \"corner maybe needs a bit of fine-tuning still.\"","Sacha Fenestraz, Jake Hughes, Daniel Ricciardo and Toto Wolff all agreed changes need to be made immediately to make the circuit safer.","Multiple other incidents have happened at the Eau Rouge\/Raidillon section of the circuit.","These include: a big crash for Kevin Magnussen in 2016, where he managed to walk away with only minor injuries; a big crash for Pietro Fittipaldi in 2018, where he broke his leg and a big crash for Jack Aitken in 2021, where he broke his collarbone.","Besides Formula 1 other races in different motorsports classes are hosted at Spa-Francorchamps.","The most notable ones are the Blancpain Endurance Series, Formula 3, the RCN, Motorbike Endurance, the ADAC GT Masters, and previously DTM and the WTCC.","The most famous long-distance and sports car races are the Spa 24 Hours and the 1000 km Spa.","The circuit also hosts a 24-hour 2CV race.","As the long-time home of the Belgian Grand Prix and its location within the Ardennes forests it has been a popular backdrop for all kinds of fictional media, from appearances in comics and motion pictures, to regular appearances in dozens of video games going back into the 1980s.","The circuit has been used several times in the Tour de France cycling race.","In 1980, the circuit was part of an individual time trial stage, won by Bernard Hinault (Renault\u2013Gitane); while in 1989, several laps of the circuit were completed before the finish of the third stage, which was won by PDM\u2013Concorde's Ra\u00fal Alcal\u00e1.","In 2017, the circuit was used as part of the third stage, starting in Verviers, Belgium and ending in Longwy, France.","The area of Spa-Francorchamps is often rainy or having cool air temperatures, which has led to Formula One events such as the 1998 14-car pileup on a waterlogged track and the dramatic finish to the 2008 event, when rain fell during the last few laps after an all-dry race.","The Royal Meteorological Institute runs weather stations both in Stavelot and in Malmedy, which both show similar oceanic climates with some interior influence.","Although temperatures generally often stay above freezing in winter, snowfall is quite common.","During summer, temperatures most often remain in the low 20s, with frequent cloud cover and showers.","With the World Endurance race running in spring and the Formula One race in late summer, hot temperatures during high-profile events are very rare."]},{"category":"Circuit","circuitId":14,"name":"Autodromo Nazionale di Monza","location":"Monza","country":"Italy","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Autodromo_Nazionale_Monza","circuit_text":["The Autodromo Nazionale di Monza is a historic is a 5.793km (3.600mi) race track near the city of Monza, north of Milan, in Italy.","Built in 1922, it was the world's third purpose-built motor racing circuit after Brooklands and Indianapolis and the oldest in mainland Europe.","The circuit's biggest event is the Italian Grand Prix.","With the exception of the 1980 running, the race has been hosted there since 1949.","Built in the Royal Villa of Monza park in a woodland setting, the site has three tracks \u2013 the 5.793-kilometre (3.600mi) Grand Prix track, the 2.405-kilometre (1.494mi) Junior track, and a 4.250-kilometre (2.641mi) high speed oval track with steep bankings which was left unused for decades and had been decaying until it was restored in the 2010s.","The major features of the main Grand Prix track include the Curva Grande, the Curva di Lesmo, the Variante Ascari and the Curva Parabolica.","The high speed curve, Curva Grande, is located after the Variante del Rettifilo which is located at the end of the front straight or Rettifilo Tribune, and is usually taken flat out by Formula One cars.","In addition to Formula One, the circuit previously hosted the 1000 km Monza, an endurance sports car race held as part of the World Sportscar Championship and the Le Mans Series.","Monza also featured the unique Race of Two Worlds events, which attempted to run Formula One and USAC National Championship cars against each other.","The racetrack also previously held rounds of the Grand Prix motorcycle racing (Italian motorcycle Grand Prix), WTCC, TCR International Series, Superbike World Championship, Formula Renault 3.5 Series and Auto GP.","Monza currently hosts rounds of the Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup, International GT Open and Euroformula Open Championship, as well as various local championships such as the TCR Italian Series, Italian GT Championship, Porsche Carrera Cup Italia and Italian F4 Championship, as well as the Monza Rally Show.","In 2020 Monza hosted the 2020 World Rally Championship final round, ACI Rally Monza, with the circuit hosting 10 of the 16 rally stages.","Monza also hosts cycling and running events, most notably the Monza 12h Cycling Marathon and Monza 21 Half Marathon.","The venue was also selected by Nike scientists for the Breaking2 event, where three runners attempted to break the 2 hour barrier for the marathon.","Eliud Kipchoge ran 2:00:25.","A very fast circuit, Monza has been the site of many fatal accidents, especially in the early years of the Formula One world championship, and has claimed the lives of 52 drivers and 35 spectators.","Track modifications have continuously occurred, to improve spectator safety and reduce curve speeds, but it is still criticised by the current drivers for its lack of run-off areas, most notoriously at the chicane that cuts the Variante della Roggia.","The first track was built from May to July 1922 by 3,500 workers, financed by the Milan Automobile Club \u2013 which created the Societ\u00e0 Incremento Automobilismo e Sport (SIAS) (English: Motoring and Sport Encouragement Company) to run the track.","The initial form was a 3.4 square kilometres (1.31sqmi) site with 10 kilometres (6.2mi) of macadamised road \u2013 comprising a 4.5 kilometres (2.80mi) loop track, and a 5.5 kilometres (3.42mi) road track.","The track was officially opened on 3 September 1922, with the maiden race the second Italian Grand Prix held on 10 September 1922.","In 1928, the most serious Italian racing accident to date ended in the death of driver Emilio Materassi and 27 spectators at that year's Italian Grand Prix.","The accident led to further Grand Prix races' confinement to the high-speed loop until 1932.","For these reasons the Italian Grand Prix wasn't held again until 1931; in the meantime the 1930 Monza Grand Prix was held on the high speed ring only, while in 1930 Vincenzo Florio introduced the Florio Circuit.","The 1933 Italian Grand Prix was held on the original complete layout but it was marred by the deaths of three drivers (Giuseppe Campari, Baconin Borzacchini and Stanislaw Czaykowski) in the supporting Monza Grand Prix held on the same day - which became known as the \"Black Day of Monza\" - over the shorter oval circuit  and the Grand Prix layout was changed: in 1934 a short circuit with two lanes of the straight line joined by a hairpin, Curva Sud of the banking (with a double chicane) driven in the opposite direction than usual, the \"Florio link\" and the Curva Sud (with a small chicane).","This configuration was considered too slow and in 1935 Florio Circuit was used again, this time with four temporary chicanes and another one permanent (along the Curva Sud of the banking).","In 1938 only the last one was used.","There was major rebuilding in 1938\u201339, constructing new stands and entrances, resurfacing the track, removing the high speed ring and adding two new bends on the southern part of the circuit.","The resulting layout gave a Grand Prix lap of 6.300 kilometres (3.91mi), in use until 1954.","The outbreak of World War II meant racing at the track was suspended until 1948 and parts of the circuit degraded due to the lack of maintenance and military use.","Monza was renovated over a period of two months at the beginning of 1948 and a Grand Prix was held on 17 October 1948.","In 1954, work began to entirely revamp the circuit, resulting in a 5.750 kilometres (3.573mi) course, and a new 4.250 kilometres (2.641mi) high-speed oval with banked sopraelevata curves (the southern one was moved slightly north).","The two circuits could be combined to re-create the former 10 kilometres (6.214mi) long circuit, with cars running parallel on the main straight.","The first Lesmo curve was modified to be made faster, and the track infrastructure and facilities were also updated and improved to better accommodate the teams and spectators.","The Automobile Club of Italy held 500-mile (805km) Race of Two Worlds exhibition competitions, intended to pit United States Auto Club IndyCars against European Formula One and sports cars.","The races were held on the oval at the end of June in 1957 and 1958, with three 63 lap 267.67 kilometres (166.32mi) heat races each year, races which colloquially became known as the Monzanapolis series.","Concerns were raised among the European drivers that flat-out racing on the banking would be too dangerous, so ultimately only Ecurie Ecosse and Maserati represented European racing  at the first running.","The American teams had brought special Firestone tyres with them, reinforced to withstand high-speed running on the bumpy Monza surface, but the Maseratis' steering was badly affected by the larger-than-usual tyre size, leading to the Modena-based team withdrawal.","Ecurie Ecosse's three Jaguar D-type sports cars used their Le Mans-specification tyres with no ill-effects, but since they raced at less than their practice speeds to conserve their tyres, they were completely out paced.","Two heats in 1957 were won by Jimmy Bryan in his Kuzma-Offenhauser Dean Van Lines Special, and the last by Troy Ruttman in the Watson-Offenhauser John Zink Special.","In 1958 Jaguar, Ferrari and Maserati teams appeared alongside the Indy roadsters, but once again the American cars dominated the event and Jim Rathmann won the three races in a Watson-Offenhauser car.","Formula One used the 10 kilometres (6.214mi) high speed track in the 1955, 1956, 1960 and 1961 Grands Prix.","Stirling Moss and Phil Hill both won twice in this period, with Hill's win at Monza making him the first American to win a Formula One race.","The 1961 race saw the death of Wolfgang von Trips and fifteen spectators when a collision with Jim Clark's Lotus sent von Trips' car airborne and into the barriers on Parabolica.","Although the accident did not occur on the oval section of the track, the high speeds were deemed unsafe and F1 use of the oval was ended; future Grands Prix were held on the shorter road circuit, with the banking appearing one last time in the film Grand Prix.","New safety walls, rails and fences were added before the next race and the refuelling area was moved further from the track.","Chicanes were added before both bankings in 1966, and another fatality in the 1968 1000km Monza race led to run-off areas added to the curves, with the track layout changing the next year to incorporate permanent chicanes before the banked curves \u2013 extending the track length by 100 metres (328ft).","The banking held the last race in 1969 with the 1000km of Monza, the event moving to the road circuit the next year.","The banking still exists, albeit in a decayed state in the years since the last race, escaping demolition in the 1990s.","It is used once a year for the Monza Rally, which served part of the 2021 FIA World Rally Championship, which was the first FIA championship event since 1969.","The banked oval was used several times for record breaking until the late 1960s, although the severe bumping was a major suspension and tyre test for the production cars attempting endurance records, such as the Ford Corsair GT which in 1964 captured 13 records.","Both car and Grand Prix motorcycle racing were regular attractions at Monza.","These races involved drivers constantly slipstreaming competing cars, which produced several close finishes, such as in 1967, 1969, and 1971.","As the speed of the machines increased, two chicanes were added in 1972 to reduce racing speeds \u2014 the Variante del Rettifilo at the middle of the start\/finish straight,  and the Variante Ascari.","This resulted in a new circuit length of 5.755 kilometres (3.576mi).","Grand Prix motorcycles continued to use the un-slowed road track until two serious accidents resulted in five deaths, including Renzo Pasolini and Jarno Saarinen, in 1973, and motorcycle racing did not return to Monza until 1981.","The 1972 chicanes were soon seen to be ineffective at slowing cars; the Vialone was remade in 1974, the other, Curva Grande in 1976, and a third also added in 1976 before the Lesmo, with extended run-off areas.","The Grand Prix lap after these alterations was increased to 5.800 kilometres (3.604mi) long.","With technology still increasing vehicle speeds the track was modified again in 1979 with added safety measures such as new kerbs, extended run-off areas and tyre-barriers to improve safety for drivers off the track.","The infrastructure was also improved, with pits able to accommodate 46 cars, and an upgraded paddock and scrutineering facilities.","These changes encouraged world championship motorcycling to return in 1981, but further safety work was undertaken through the 1980s.","Also in the 1980s the podium, paddock and pits complex, stands, and camp site were either rebuilt or improved.","As motorsport became more safety conscious following the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger in 1994 at the Imola circuit, the three main long curves were \"squeezed\" in order to install larger gravel traps, shortening the lap to 5.770 kilometres (3.585mi).","In 1997 the stands were reworked to expand capacity to 51,000.","In 2000, the chicane on the main straight was altered, changing from a double left-right chicane to a single right-left chicane in an attempt to reduce the frequent accidents at the starts due to the conformation of the braking area, although it is still deemed unsafe in terms of motorcycle racing.","The second chicane was also re-profiled.","In the Formula 1 Grand Prix of the same year, the first to use these new chicanes, a fire marshal, Paolo Gislimberti, was killed by flying debris after a big pileup at the second chicane.","In 2007, the run-off area at the second chicane was changed from gravel to asphalt.","The length of the track in its current configuration is 5.793 kilometres (3.600mi).","At the 2010 Monza Superbike World Championship round, Italian rider Max Biaggi set the fastest ever motorcycle lap of Monza when he rode his Aprilia RSV4 1000 F to pole position in a time of 1:42.121.","In the Superpole qualification for the 2011 race, he improved on this lap time, for a new lap record of 1:41.745 and his speed was captured at 205+ MPH.","In late 2016, work was planned on a new first bend, which would have bypassed the first chicane and the Curva Grande.","Drivers were to go through a fast right hand kink and into a new, faster chicane.","Work was planned for to be completed by 2017 in hopes of a renewed contract for Formula 1.","Gravel would have also returned to the run-off area at the Parabolica bend.","However, plans for the track's change were suspended due to the track being in the historic Monza Park.","Monza, throughout its long and storied history has been known for its high-speed, simplistic nature thanks to its 1920s design and the few alterations it has received, and is currently the fastest track on the Formula One calendar and has been so since 1991.","Monza consists of very long straights and tight chicanes, putting a premium on good braking stability and traction.","The 5.793 kilometres (3.600mi) circuit is very hard on engines; Formula 1 engines are at full throttle for nearly 80% of the lap, with engine failures common, notably Fernando Alonso in the 2006 Italian Grand Prix.","Drivers are on full throttle for most of the lap due to its long straights and fast corners, and is usually the scenario in which the open-wheeled Formula One cars show the raw speed of which they are capable: 372 kilometres per hour (231mph) during the mid-2000s V10 engine formula, although in 2012 with the 2.4L V8 engines, top speeds in Formula One rarely reached over 340 kilometres per hour (211mph); the 1.6L turbocharged hybrid V6 engine, reduced-downforce formula of 2014 displayed top speeds of up to 360 kilometres per hour (224mph).","The circuit is generally flat, but has a gradual gradient from the second Lesmos to the Variante Ascari.","Due to the low aerodynamic profile needed, with its resulting low downforce, the grip is very low; understeer is a more serious issue than at other circuits; however, the opposite effect, oversteer, is also present in the second sector, requiring the use of a very distinctive opposite lock technique.","Since both maximum power and minimal drag are keys for speed on the straights, only competitors with enough power or aerodynamic efficiency at their disposal are able to challenge for the top places.","Formula One cars are set up with one of the smallest wing angles on the F1 calendar to ensure the lowest level of drag on the straights.","There are only 6 corner complexes at Monza: the first two chicanes, the two Lesmos, the Ascari complex and the Parabolica.","Thus cars are set up for maximum performance on the straights.","Cars approach the first corner at 340 kilometres per hour (210mph) in eighth gear, and brake at about 120 metres (390ft) before the first chicane\u2014the Variante del Rettifilo\u2014entering at 86km\/h (53mph) in second gear, and exiting at 74 kilometres per hour (46mph) in second gear.","This is the scene of many first-lap accidents.","Higher kerbs were installed at the first two chicanes in 2009 to prevent cutting.","Good traction out of the first corner is imperative for a quick lap.","Conservation of speed through the first chicane is made possible by driving the straightest line, as a small mistake here can result in a lot of time being lost through the Curva Grande down to the Variante della Roggia chicane in eighth gear, at 330 kilometres per hour (210mph).","The braking point is just under the bridge.","The kerbs are brutal and it is very easy for a car to become unbalanced and a driver to lose control, as Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen did in 2005.","This chicane is probably the best overtaking chance on the lap, as it is the only one with the \"slow corner, long straight, slow corner\"; one of the characteristics of modern circuits.","The Curve di Lesmo are two corners that are not as fast as they used to be, but are still challenging corners.","The first is blind, entered at 264km\/h (164mph) in sixth gear, apexing at 193km\/h (120mph), and has a slight banking.","The second is a seventh gear entry at 260km\/h (160mph), apexing in fifth gear at 178 kilometres per hour (111mph), and it is very important that all the kerb is used.","A mistake at one of these corners will result in a spin into the gravel, while good exits can set a driver up for an overtaking move into Variante Ascari.","The downhill straight down to Variante Ascari is very bumpy under the bridge.","Variante Ascari is a very tricky sequence of corners and is key to the lap time.","The final challenge is the Curva Parabolica: approaching at 335 kilometres per hour (208mph) in eighth gear, cars quickly dance around the corner, apexing in sixth gear at 215 kilometres per hour (134mph) and exiting in sixth gear at 285 kilometres per hour (177mph), accelerating onto the main start\/finish straight.","A good exit and slipstream off a fellow driver along the main straight can produce an overtaking opportunity under heavy braking into Variante del Rettifilo; however, it is difficult to follow a leading car closely through the Parabolica as the tow will reduce downforce and cornering speed.","Maximum speed achieved in a 2021 Formula One car is 362.0km\/h (224.9mph), established at the end of the start\/finish straight.","They experience a maximum g-force of 4.50 during deceleration, and the track has many dramatic high to low speed transitions.","Lewis Hamilton recorded the fastest pole position lap at Monza in 2020, when he lapped in 1:18.887 at an average speed of 264.362km\/h (164.267mph)\u2014the fastest average lap speed recorded in qualifying for a World Championship event."]},{"category":"Circuit","circuitId":15,"name":"Marina Bay Street

Singapore Street Circuit) is a street circuit around Marina Bay, Singapore, encompassing the planning areas of Downtown Core (Turns 4 to 23) and Kallang (Turns 1 to 3).","It is the venue for the Singapore Grand Prix.","The track is 5.063km (3.146mi) long in a harbourside location similar in style to the Circuit de Monaco and the Valencia Street Circuit.","The circuit is designed by KBR, Inc., a modification of the original one first proposed by Hermann Tilke.","The circuit has a FIA Grade 1 license.","The circuit holds a unique record of having at least one safety car appearance in every race to date.","There has been a total of 21 safety car deployments in twelve races.","On the day of confirmation of the Singapore Grand Prix in the 2008 Formula One season, a routemap was published.","The pit area of the circuit is located in an empty plot of land off Republic Boulevard and beside the Singapore Flyer.","A temporary road leads from the pit area and under the Benjamin Sheares Bridge to Republic Boulevard and turns onto Raffles Boulevard.","It then proceeds along Nicoll Highway, Stamford Road and Saint Andrew's Road around the Padang, past the City Hall.","The track then goes onto the Anderson Bridge, past the Fullerton Hotel and make a tight left turn to Esplanade Drive beside the Merlion Park.","It joins Raffles Avenue and cuts right after the Esplanade to the front of The Float @ Marina Bay, then returning to the pit area via a second temporary road around the Singapore Flyer.","The track layout is unique in that in between turns 18 and 19, the cars race underneath a section of grandstand of the Floating Platform.","The track was widely criticised by F1 drivers to be excessively bumpy, particularly on Raffles Boulevard between turns 5 and 7, resulting in a very unforgiving circuit, especially given the hot and humid conditions of the Singapore climate.","2008 World Champion Lewis Hamilton commented that it was twice as hard to negotiate as the more famous Monaco street circuit and unexpectedly physical\u2013 requiring double the amount of energy over a single lap as compared to the Monaco circuit.","Several drivers, including S\u00e9bastien Bourdais and Fernando Alonso, expressed their concern about the high and harsh kerbs at the chicane at turn 10 of the street circuit.","Ferrari's Felipe Massa compared the kerbs akin to \"little tortoises that would wreck the car if you get something wrong\".","The drivers were worried that hitting the bumps could cause suspension damage or even damage a tub.","They also raised concerns that the bumps would pitch them into the wall on the outside of the corner.","Whilst the FIA had been involved in the development of these kerbs, in response to the drivers' concerns FIA race director and safety delegate Charlie Whiting agreed to lower the kerbs at the turn 10 chicane ahead of Friday's free practice.","The kerbs were further reduced in height for Saturday's qualifying round and Sunday's race.","The chicane at Turn 10 was reprofiled for the 2010 race in an attempt to make it safer and the turns more gradual by moving the kerbs, however Lewis Hamilton said in an interview this modification made the chicane more dangerous by making the entry to the corner smaller, calling the complex \"the worst corner in F1\".","In 2013, ahead of the race, the chicane was removed and replaced with a left turn, resulting in faster lap times.","The entry of the pit lane, which begins at the penultimate corner of the 23-turn layout, was deemed to be \"difficult and incredibly dangerous\" by several drivers due to the fast nature of the corners where they were situated.","The problem was deemed to be primarily due to the speed differential of those entering the pits and those continuing on another lap and their sharing of the same race line.","The controversial pit entry at Singapore was then modified ahead of Saturday's qualifying round by extending the pit entry line away from the pits.","This change compelled drivers to commit to the pit entry earlier, providing additional warning to those following behind.In March 2009, three of the circuit's corners were given names after a competition amongst local F1 fans to submit ideas.","Turn 1 was named Sheares after Benjamin Henry Sheares, the second president of Singapore; Turn 7 was named Memorial due to its proximity to a Second World War civilian memorial; and Turn 10 was named Singapore Sling.","The Singapore Sling was changed for the 2013 Grand Prix and Turn 10 is now a flowing left-hander.","Drivers have commented that without the Singapore Sling chicane, the track is much more manageable.","In January 2010, it was reported that race organisers were considering changes to the circuit for the 2011 season.","No major changes were made to the layout for the 2011 race, however Singapore Tourism Board has sought submissions on opportunities to reinvigorate the layout or completely relocate it in the future.","For the 2013 season, the FIA approved of track configuration changes.","The Turn 10 chicane, known as 'Singapore Sling', was removed and replaced with a single-apex left-hand bend.","The corner entry speed increased by about 40km\/h (25mph).","As a safety measure to compensate for the higher speeds, an extra layer of TecPro barriers were added to the end of the Turn 10 run-off.","In 2015, the FIA approved minor changes to the layout of the Marina Bay Street Circuit ahead of the 2015 Singapore Grand Prix.","The modifications run from Turn 11 to Turn 13; drivers will still turn right at Turn 11 but it will now kink left slightly on entry, with the track shifting to the left-hand side of Fullerton Road.","This will change the profile of Turn 12, as drivers will now use the other side of the Anderson Bridge, while the hairpin at Turn 13 has been widened by a metre in order to increase overtaking opportunities.","Other changes were made before the 2018 Singapore Grand Prix, reprofiling the track at turns 16 and 17, taking it from a length of 5.065km (3.147mi) to the current 5.063km (3.146mi).","For the purpose of the night race, approximately 1600 custom-made

used for national races.","Speeds continued to be very high, and two chicanes were added to the track: one after the first hairpin corner, the second at the entry to the wide, fast final turn (300R).","Even with these changes, the main feature of the track remained its approximately 1.5km (0.93mi) long straight, one of the longest in all of motorsports.","The long pit straight has also been utilised for drag racing.","NHRA exhibitions were run in 1989, and in 1993 Shirley Muldowney ran a 5.30 on the quarter-mile strip at Fuji.","Local drag races are common on the circuit, at both 440yd (402.336m) & 1,000ft (304.800m) distances.","The track continued to be used for Japanese national races.","Plans to host a CART event in 1991 were abandoned due to conflicts with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile.","It was not until the autumn of 2000 that the majority of the stocks of the track were bought by Toyota from Mitsubishi Estate as part of its motor racing plans for the future.","On May 3, 1998, there was a multi-car crash during a parade lap before a JGTC race caused by the safety car slowing in torrential rain.","Ferrari driver Tetsuya Ota suffered serious burns over his entire body after being trapped in his car for almost 90 seconds, and Porsche driver Tomohiko Sunako fractured his right leg.","In 2003, the circuit was closed down to accommodate a major reprofiling of the track, using a new design from Hermann Tilke.","The track was reopened on April 10, 2005, and hosted its first Formula One championship event in 29 years on September 30, 2007.","In circumstances similar to Fuji's first Grand Prix in 1976, the race was run in heavy rain and mist and the first 19 laps were run under the safety car, in a race won by Lewis Hamilton.","The circuit has hosted the Nismo Festival for historic Nissan racers since refurbishment in 2003; the event previously took place at Okayama.","When the festival returned in 2005, the organisers allowed circuit owner Toyota to bring in their Toyota 7 CanAm racer to re-enact an old Japanese GP battle.","Toyota also hosts its own historic event a week before the NISMO festival called the Toyota Motorsports Festival.","Close to the circuit is a drifting course, which was built as part of the refurbishment under the supervision of \"Drift King\" Keiichi Tsuchiya and former works driver and Super GT team manager Masanori Sekiya.","There is a Toyota Safety Education Center and a mini circuit.","In addition to motorsports, Fuji also hosts the Udo Music Festival.","The only time the circuit is run on a reverse direction is during the D1 Grand Prix round, as Keiichi Tsuchiya felt the new layout meant reduced entry speed, making it less suitable for drifting.","The series has hosted its rounds since 2003; with the exception of the 2004 closure, the circuit became the first to take place on an international level racetrack and the first of the three to take place on an F1 circuit.","The drift course starts from the 300R section and ends past the Coca-Cola corner.","With the reprofiling, as cars no longer run downbank, entry speeds have since been reduced, the hill at the exit making acceleration difficult.","As part of the 2003 renovations, most of the old banked section of track was demolished.","Only a small section remains to this day.","Fuji Speedway was announced to host the finish of the road cycling races at the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Paralympics.","During the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix, Fuji Speedway met with a lot of problems, including the paralysis of the transportation network provided by the shuttle buses, poor facilities including some reserved seats without a view, lack of organization, and expensive meals such as simple lunch boxes being sold for 10,000 yen (US $87) at the circuit.","Newspaper accounts of the event also alleged problems with Toyota bias and control.","The circuit prohibited spectators from setting up flags and banners to support teams and drivers, with the exception of the Toyota F1 team.","Therefore, there were very few flags and banners in the event compared with other Grand Prix events.","For the 2008 Japanese Grand Prix race, organizers responded to lessons learned the previous year by reducing the total number of spectators allowed at the event.","Compared to 140,000 persons allowed for Sunday events in 2007, attendance was restricted to 110,000.","Additionally, walkways and spectator facilities were improved, along with larger screens.","However, the race was also affected by rainy weather, which has historically interfered in a number of past races at the circuit, and later in 2013, led to interference with a 6-hour endurance race at the track for the FIA World Endurance Championship.","Following both poor ticket sales and weather, it was decided by FOM that the FIA Japanese Grand Prix would be shared between Fuji and Suzuka on alternate years, with Suzuka holding the next race on Sunday, October 4, 2009.","After the global recession and its own operational deficit, Toyota decided to discontinue the hosting of Japanese Grand Prix since 2010.","This is the official listing of the twelve corners that make up the current circuit layout, in use since 2005.","Only some corners have Japanese names, most of which are a result of sponsorship agreements.","The rest are named after the radius of the corner in metres.","The Dunlop corner differs with the configuration used.","In the full configuration, it consists of a tight right hairpin turn followed by a left-right flick.","In the GT course, it is a medium-speed right-hander, bypassing turns 11 and 12.","The Fuji circuit is represented in the arcade racing game Pole Position.","Fuji is also featured in Project CARS 2, Top Gear, TOCA Race Driver, Gran Turismo 4: Prologue, Gran Turismo 4, Tourist Trophy, Gran Turismo 5: Prologue, Gran Turismo (PSP), Gran Turismo 5,

no-expense-spared facility, conceived by the Shanghai authorities as a way to showcase the city to the world.","A 5.3 sq km site was chosen in the Jiading District in the north west of the city, close to major car parts manufacturing facilities and a budget of 2.6 billion yuan ($450 million) raised through a government-funded joint-venture company, the Shanghai Jiushi Group.","Herman Tilke was chosen to design the track and associated buildings, and between April and May 2003, engineers visited the site to draw up their plans.","The site was actually a swampland, previously used as rice paddy fields, and extensive groundworks had to be completed to construct the circuit.","For 18 months some 3,000 workers were on site daily to complete the facility \u2013 a remarkable feat of both engineering and logistics.","When it opened, visitors found a vast complex, dominated by the main grandstand and pit complex, which featured wing-like viewing platforms crossing the circuit at either end.","This can hold 30,000 spectators alone, and others around the circuit take the total capacity to 200,000.","Paddock facilities were also unique \u2013 each of the F1 teams had its own building, arranged like pavilions in a lake to resemble the ancient Yu Garden in Shanghai.","The track layout was inspired from the Chinese character shang (\u4e0a), the first character in the name of the city Shanghai , meaning \"above\" or \"ascend\".","There\u2019s a unique start to the lap as the drivers fly into the ever-tightening Turns 1 and 2, before they dart left through 3 and 4.","The super-high g force Turns 7 and 8 are loved by the drivers, while the circuit also features one of the longest straights on the calendar, the 1.2km stretch that separates turns 13 and 14.","The Shanghai International Circuit is the first in China to be purpose-built for Formula One and it hosts FIA Formula One World Championship Chinese Grand Prix every year since 2004.","The circuit also holds a number of global high-profile series, including the FIA World Endurance Championship and the Blancpain GT Series Asia.","In the past, the circuit has hosted the MotoGP world championship, and a one-off V8 Supercars China Round of the Australian-based V8 Supercar championship in 2005, and also the final round of the A1 Grand Prix in 2006\/2007.","The first two bends make a 185km\/h  right-hand curve which leads immediately into turns 3 and 4 taken at 105km\/h.","One and two are far more difficult \u2013 a lift on entry followed by various taps of the throttle and brakes are needed so the car maintains balance throughout.","It also becomes blind towards the middle of the corner.","Three and four are less complicated, with three being a simple hairpin, but  a good exit is needed from four to gain speed down the following straight and through turn 5.","The complex of turns 1\u20134 makes up the first of two \"snails\" on the circuit, the other being turns 11\u201313.","Turn 6 is a second gear, right-handed hairpin with plentiful run-off.","Turns 7 and 8 make up a high speed chicane \u2013 the left-right complex sees a constant G-force of 3 and a minimum speed of about 160km\/h.","Turns 9 and 10 immediately follow \u2013 two slow left-handers which require a good exit to gain speed down the next straight.","Turns 11 and 12 effectively make up a slow left-right chicane where the use of kerbs are important but traction is low.","Turn 13 is a very long right-hander which becomes less and less tight, and a very good exit is important as DRS is available down the following straight.","At 1170m, it is the equivalent to 11 football pitches laid end to end, or the same length as three and a half of the world's biggest aircraft carriers Turn 14 is a hairpin at the end of the straight \u2013 the second gear corner is a prime overtaking spot as DRS is available in the run up to the corner.","Turn 16 is the last corner \u2013 a fourth-gear

motorsport circuit located in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, in the neighborhood of Interlagos.","It was renamed after Brazilian Formula One driver Carlos Pace, who died in a plane crash in 1977.","It has hosted the Formula One Brazilian Grand Prix since 1973.","It also hosted the Brazilian motorcycle Grand Prix in 1990, the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft in 1996, the FIA GT1 World Championship in 2010, and the FIA World Endurance Championship from 2012.","As the major racetrack in the country, it also hosts national championships such as Stock Car Brasil, Campeonato Sudamericano de GT, F\u00f3rmula Truck, Copa Truck, Formula 3 Sudamericana and Mil Milhas Brasil.","In addition, the Prova Cicl\u00edstica 9 de Julho road cycling race was held at the venue from 2002 to 2006 and from 2008 to 2013.","The land on which the circuit is located was originally bought in 1926 by property developers who wanted to build housing.","Following difficulties partly due to the 1929 stock market crash, it was decided to build a racing circuit instead, construction started in 1938 and the track was inaugurated in May 1940.","The design was based on New York's Roosevelt Field Raceway (1937 layout).","The traditional name of the circuit (literally, \"between lakes\") comes from its location on the neighborhood of Interlagos, a region between two large artificial lakes, Guarapiranga and Billings, which were built in the early 20th century to supply the city with water and electric power.","It was renamed in 1985 from \"Aut\u00f3dromo de Interlagos\" to its current name to honor the Brazilian Formula One driver Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace, who died in a plane crash in 1977.","Formula One started racing there in 1972, the first year being a non-championship race, won by Argentinean Carlos Reutemann.","The first World Championship Brazilian Grand Prix was held at Interlagos in 1973, the race won by defending Formula One World Champion and S\u00e3o Paulo local Emerson Fittipaldi.","Fittipaldi won the race again the following year in bad weather and Brazilian driver Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace won his only race at Interlagos in 1975.","Due to safety concerns with the 4.9 mile circuit, including the bumpy track surface and the inadequate barriers, deep ditches, and embankments, the last Formula One race held on the original Interlagos was in 1980, the race was nearly cancelled after protests by many Formula One drivers including defending world champion Jody Scheckter.","The safety concerns were somewhat directed towards the track surface, which BBC commentator Murray Walker described as \"appallingly bumpy\".","Most of the ground-effect cars of 1980 were designed in such a way that bumpy surfaces were barely tolerable for the drivers.","These factors meant that Formula One would move back to the Jacarepagu\u00e1 circuit in Rio de Janeiro, hometown of established star Nelson Piquet and where the Brazilian Grand Prix was held in 1978.","After Formula One moved away, the only major race being held at Interlagos was the Mil Milhas Brasil, and the last major race on the original circuit was the 1989 Mil Milhas Brasil, and Formula One returned to the circuit the following year after it had been shortened and modified at a cost of $15 million.","The track layout, aside from the pit exit being extended along the Curva do Sol over the years has remained the same since 1990.","After the ascendancy of another S\u00e3o Paulo local, Ayrton Senna, negotiations were made to return to Interlagos that year, and it has stayed there ever since.","The facilities include a kart circuit named after Senna.","The circuit now also hosts the Brazilian Formula Three Championship.","The circuit is often witness to dramatic results when it hosts the Formula One Brazilian Grand Prix, especially since its move to an end of season slot in 2004.","Fernando Alonso won both the 2005 and 2006 world titles in Brazil, with Renault also clinching the constructors' title in 2006.","Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen won the 2007 World Championship here after being seven points down and in third place in the championship entering the final race of the season.","Felipe Massa almost won the 2008 Driver's World Championship when he finished the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix as winner, but after he finished, Lewis Hamilton overtook Timo Glock and was crowned World Champion.","Despite Rubens Barrichello's pole position in 2009, Mark Webber won the race and Jenson Button won the championship for Brawn after starting 14th.","Williams got their first pole since 2005 here at the 2010 Brazilian Grand Prix with Nico H\u00fclkenberg.","The race was won by Sebastian Vettel, and with Mark Webber coming second, Red Bull secured the constructors title; however the driver's title was not confirmed until the last race of the season.","The circuit is one of a minority of non-oval racing circuits to go in an anti-clockwise direction.","In 1979 upgrading work was done and the pit lane was extended past the first left-hand turn (Curva 1), making the corner more narrow, and the pit lane ended right in the middle of Curva 1 and 2.","The present design of the track dates back to 1990, when the original circuit was shortened from 7.87385km to 4.325km.","As a consequence of the reduction, the track lost three long straight sections and nine fast curves (5 were lost forever, 4 were made slower and are still there).","The original track was full of fast corners and it allowed cars to keep maximum speed for up to twenty seconds and was considered very dangerous (although no one ever died there whilst racing Formula One) and in 1990 the old layout was majorly revised.","The new track still had a very long top-speed section that contained bumps, high-speed turns and little run-off area (though the track was very wide at this point).","One reason why many drivers consider Interlagos interesting is that it was not built on flat terrain, but follows the ups and downs of hilly ground, which makes it harder to drive and demands more power from the car's engines.","The hilly course is also a good feature for road cycling races usually held at the circuit.","The circuit is known for its many inclines and formerly bumpy surface, which could take its toll on F1 cars because they have a very low ride height and little suspension travel.","The races are therefore very tough on the car, and also physically tough on the drivers, especially since the circuit is anti-clockwise, where the centrifugal forces in the many hard left turns push the drivers' necks to the right, instead of left as in the majority of circuits on the F1 calendar.","For the 2007 Brazilian Grand Prix, the largest-scale repairs in the last 35 years were carried out at the circuit, to fundamentally solve problems with the track surface.","The existing asphalt was entirely replaced, resulting in a much smoother track surface.","At the same time, the pit lane entrance was enhanced to improve safety and to add a new fixed grand stand.","To facilitate the work, the circuit was closed and no events were held in the five months immediately preceding the race.","On 17 October 2007, Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM) began to operate the new station of the Line C (currently called Line 9), Aut\u00f3dromo, near the circuit.","The Line C had been extended to improve the access between the center of S\u00e3o Paulo and southern region of the Greater S\u00e3o Paulo including the circuit, improving circuit accessibility.","Shortly before the 2011 Brazilian Grand Prix, FIA race director Charlie Whiting detailed several planned upgrades of the circuit, including a new pit entrance and expanded run-off at the final corner, as a response to several fatal accidents at the circuit in 2011.","In June 2012, further details of the proposed plans emerged, calling for the construction of a brand new pit building and the relocation of the start line from its current position between Arquibancadas and the Senna 'S' to Reta Oposta.","However, later it was decided to keep start\/finish straight at its current location along with the new pit building.","Interlagos has one of the longest pit-lanes ever used in Formula One, starting just before the start-finish straight and rejoining the main course after Curva do Sol.","Entering the pits was originally not a trivial task, as the high speed and the left turning may force the car rightwards, out of the pits.","The pit lane entrance received some changes to become safer for the 2007 Formula One Brazilian Grand Prix, and later for the 2014 Formula One Brazilian Grand Prix, when a chicane was added.","Race start is in the \"Tribunas\" section and features a long straight with an upward inclination, then comes \"S do Senna\" (the Senna S) [1, 2], a pair of alternating downward turns (left then right) that exhibit different attack angles and inclinations.","\"S do Senna\" connects with \"Curva do Sol\" (Curve of the Sun) [3], a round-shaped large-radius left turn that leads to \"Reta Oposta\" (Opposite Straight) the track's longest (but not the fastest) straight.","Reta Oposta is succeeded by a pair of downhill left turns that are called \"Descida do Lago\" (Lake's Descent) [4 & 5] into a short straight section that climbs up towards the back of the pit buildings.","This is followed by a slow section, with small, kart-like turns and elevation changes.","The first of these turns is known as \"Ferradura\" (Horseshoe) [6,7] downhill and right into \"Laranjinha\" (Little Orange) [8], another right turn and the slowest point of the circuit; the next turn leads into \"Pinheirinho\" (Little Pine Tree) [9], left on a plain field; then comes \"Bico de Pato\" (Duck Bill) [10] a right turn with a tight hairpin like shape; and then \"Mergulho\" (Dive) [11], a constant-radius left-hand turn that slings the driver straight into a harder left at \"Jun\u00e7\u00e3o\" (Junction) [12].","Turn [13] \"Caf\u00e9\" (Coffee), is a left up-hill kink and marks the start of the long top-speed section.","Rising up through \"Subida dos Boxes\" (Up to the Pits) [14], the driver encounters a long uphill left turn with a gradient of 10% that demands a lot of power from the cars.","At the end of it comes Arquibancadas (Bleachers) [15], a wide high velocity left turn that connects to the \"Tribunas\" straight to complete the final section of the track.","The series of left turns from the exit of \"Jun\u00e7\u00e3o\" all the way to Turn 1 is typically taken at full throttle and treated as a long straight.","This section is one of the longest full-throttle stretches on the Formula 1 calendar, and thus demanding of the engine's reliability.","Other notable stretches of this nature are the \"Rettifilo Tribune\" straight at Autodromo Nazionale di Monza and the Kemmel Straight at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps."]},{"category":"Circuit","circuitId":19,"name":"Indianapolis Motor

garage area is known as Gasoline Alley.","On November 4, 2019, Hulman & Company announced the sale of its company, including the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the IndyCar Series and associated enterprises to Penske Corporation, owned by Roger Penske.","Indianapolis businessman Carl G. Fisher first envisioned building the speedway in 1905 after assisting friends racing in France and seeing that Europe held the upper hand in automobile design and craftsmanship.","Fisher began thinking of a better means of testing cars before delivering them to consumers.","At the time, racing was just getting started on horse tracks and public roads.","Fisher noticed how dangerous and ill-suited the makeshift courses were for racing and testing.","He also argued that spectators did not get their money's worth, as they were able to get only a brief glimpse of cars speeding down a linear road.","Fisher began looking around the Indianapolis area for a site to build his track; he rejected two potential sites before finding level farmland, Pressley Farm, totaling 328 acres (133ha) about 5 miles (8km) outside Indianapolis.","In December 1908, he convinced James A. Allison, Arthur Newby, and Frank W. Wheeler to join him in purchasing the property for $72,000.","The group incorporated the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Company on March 20, 1909, with a capitalization of $250,000, with Fisher and James Allison in for $75,000 apiece and Frank Wheeler and Arthur Newby on board for $50,000 each.","Construction of the track started in March 1909.","Fisher had to quickly downsize his planned 3-mile (5km) oval with a 2-mile (3km) road course to a 2.5-mile (4.0km) oval to leave room for the grandstands.","Reshaping of the land for the speedway took 500 laborers, 300 mules and a fleet of steam-powered machinery.","The track surface consisted of graded and packed soil covered by 2 inches (5cm) of gravel, 2 inches (5cm) of limestone covered with taroid (a solution of tar and oil), 1\u20132 inches (3\u20135cm) of crushed stone chips that were also drenched with taroid, and a final topping of crushed stone.","Workers also constructed dozens of buildings, several bridges, grandstands with 12,000 seats, and an 8-foot (2.4m) perimeter fence.","A white-with-green-trim paint scheme was used throughout the property.","The first event ever held at the speedway was a helium gas-filled balloon competition on Saturday, June 5, 1909, more than two months before the oval was completed.","The event drew a reported 40,000 people.","Nine balloons lifted off \"racing\" for trophies; a balloon by the name of Universal City won the race, landing 382 miles (615km) away in Alabama after spending more than a day aloft.","The first motorsport event at the track consisted of seven motorcycle races, sanctioned by the Federation of American Motorcyclists (FAM), on August 14, 1909.","This was originally planned as a two-day, 15-race program, but ended before the first day was completed due to concerns over suitability of the track surface for motorcycle use.","These early events were largely planned by one of the top names in early auto racing promotion, Ernest Moross, who earned fame for his bold and sometimes outlandish barnstorming events at fairgrounds tracks with racing star Barney Oldfield.","On August 19, 1909, fifteen carmakers' teams arrived at the track for practice.","The track surface again became a concern with drivers being covered in dirt, oil, and tar and with ruts and chuckholes beginning to form in the turns.","Speedway workers oiled and rolled the track prior to the gates opening to the public.","Fifteen to twenty thousand spectators showed up, paying at the most $1 for a ticket.","Halfway through the first 250-mile (400km) event, race leader Louis Chevrolet was temporarily blinded when a stone smashed his goggles.","Wilfred Bourque, driving in a Knox, suffered a suspected rear-axle failure resulting in his car flipping end over end on the front stretch before crashing into a fence post.","Both he and his mechanic, Harry Halcomb, died at the scene.","The first day of car racing resulted in four finishes and two land speed records, but concerns over safety led AAA officials to consider canceling the remaining events.","Fisher promised the track would be repaired by the next day and convinced officials that the show should go on.","The second day saw 20,000 spectators, no major incidents, and additional speed records broken.","On the third day of racing, 35,000 spectators showed up to watch the grand finale 300-mile (480km) race.","At 175 miles (282km) into the race, the right front tire blew on Charlie Merz's car.","His car mowed down five fence posts and toppled dozens of spectators.","Two spectators and his mechanic, Claude Kellum, were killed in the crash.","Ten laps later, driver Bruce Keen struck a pothole and crashed into a bridge support.","The race was then halted and the remaining drivers were given engraved certificates instead of trophies.","The race resulted in the AAA boycotting any future events at the speedway until significant improvements were made.","Fisher and his partners began looking into the idea of paving the track with bricks or concrete.","Paving in 1909 was still relatively new with only a few miles of public roads paved, leaving little knowledge of what would work best.","Traction tests were conducted on bricks, proving they could hold up.","Less than a month after the first car races, the repaving project began.","Five Indiana manufacturers supplied 3.2million 10-pound (4.5kg) bricks to the track.","Each was hand laid over a 2-inch (51mm) cushion of sand, then leveled and the gaps filled with mortar.","At the same time, a concrete wall 33 inches (840mm) tall was constructed in front of the main grandstand and around all four corners to protect spectators.","The final brick added to the track was made of gold and laid in a special ceremony by Governor Thomas R. Marshall.","Before the work was completed, locals nicknamed the track The Brickyard.","Today, 3 feet (0.91m), or one yard, of original bricks remain exposed at the start-finish line.","In December 1909, eleven drivers and a few motorcyclists returned for speed trials.","Drivers soon reached speeds of up to 112mph (180km\/h) on the new surface.","Racing returned in 1910, with a total of 66 automobile races held during three holiday weekends (Memorial Day, Independence Day and Labor Day).","Each weekend featured two or three races of 100 to 200 miles (160 to 320km), with several shorter contests.","Each race stood on its own and earned its own trophy.","All races were sanctioned by the AAA (as were the Indianapolis 500 races through 1955).","1910 also saw the speedway host the National Aviation Meet, featuring Wilbur and Orville Wright and highlighted by Walter Brookins setting a world record by taking a plane up to 4,938 feet (1,505m).","A change in marketing focus led to only one race per year beginning in 1911.","An estimated 80,000 spectators attended the first 500-mile (800km) race on Memorial Day, May 30, 1911.","Forty cars competed with Ray Harroun winning at an average speed of 74.602 miles per hour (120.060km\/h).","While all the other drivers in the race had a riding mechanic in their car, Harroun decided to save weight and go faster by driving solo.","So, to be able to see what was happening behind his No.","32 Marmon \"Wasp\", he installed a rear-view mirror.","It was the first time such a device was used in an automobile.","A classic race followed in 1912, when Ralph DePalma lost a five-lap lead with five laps to go after his car broke down.","As DePalma pushed his car around the circuit, Joe Dawson made up the deficit to win.","Three of the next four winners were European, with DePalma being the exception as an American national, though originally Italian born.","These races gave Indy a worldwide reputation and international drivers began to enter.","The 1916 race was shortened to 120 laps, for a number of reasons including a lack of entries from Europe (there were so few entries that the speedway itself entered several cars), a lack of oil, and out of respect for the war in Europe.","On September 9, 1916, the speedway hosted a day of short racing events termed the \"Harvest Classic\", composed of three races held at 20-, 50-, and 100-mile (32, 80 and 160km) distances.","In the end, Johnny Aitken, in a Peugeot, would win all three events, his final victories at the facility.","The Harvest Classic contests were the last races other than the Indianapolis 500 to be held on the grounds for seventy-eight years.","Racing was interrupted in 1917\u20131918 by World War I when the facility served as a military aviation repair and refueling depot, designated the Speedway Aviation Repair Depot, commanded by Captain Patrick Frissell.","When racing resumed, speeds quickly increased.","In 1921, speedway co-founder Wheeler committed suicide.","At the 1925 event, Pete DePaolo became the first to average 100mph (160km\/h) for the race, with a speed of 101.13mph (162.75km\/h).","In 1926, Fisher and Allison were offered \"a fortune\" for the speedway site by a local real estate developer.","They refused, selling instead to former racing driver (and World War One fighter ace) Edward V. Rickenbacker in 1927.","How much he paid was not revealed.","Rickenbacker built a golf course in the infield.","The next year, Allison died from pneumonia.","With the Great Depression hitting the nation, the purse dropped from a winners share of $50,000 and a total of $98,250 in 1930 to $18,000 and $54,450, respectively.","There is a common misconception the rules were \"dumbed down\" to what was called the \"junkyard formula\" to allow more entries during the depression.","The rules were indeed changed, but it was due to an effort by the speedway to get more car manufacturers involved in the race by discouraging the entry of specialized racing machines that dominated the 500 during the mid- to late-1920s.","The rule changes, in fact, were already being laid out before the market crash.","In 1931, Dave Evans performed a remarkable feat when his Cummins Diesel Special completed the entire 500 miles without a pit stop.","It was also the first diesel entrant.","In 1933, a record 42 cars started the 500.","For 1934, a maximum fuel consumption limit was imposed, 45USgal (37impgal; 170l).","It became 42.5USgal (35.4impgal; 161l) in 1935 and 37.5USgal (31.2impgal; 142l) in 1936.","When the limits resulted in several top competitors running out of fuel in the closing stages, the limits were abandoned, though the use of pump gasoline was still mandatory.","By the early 1930s, rising race speeds began to make the track increasingly dangerous, and in the period 1931\u20131935, there were 15 fatalities.","This forced another repavement, with tarmac replacing the bricks in parts of the track.","In addition, during the 1935\u201336 seasons the inside wall was removed in the corners, the outside wall was realigned (to change the angle compared to the track, reducing the potential for cars to vault over it), hard crash helmets became mandatory, and the first yellow light system was installed around the track.","The continuing track dangers during this period, however, did not stop Louis Meyer or Wilbur Shaw from becoming the first two three-time winners, with Shaw also being the first back-to-back winner in 1939 and 1940.","At the beginning of the 1940s, the track required further improvements.","In 1941, about a third of the \"Gasoline Alley\" garage area burned down before the race.","With U.S. involvement in World War II, the 1942 500-mile race was canceled in December 1941.","Owner Eddie Rickenbacker said the race would be suspended for the duration of the war.","In 1942, AAA Contest Board suspended all auto racing, and the U.S. government moved to ban all auto racing, primarily on account of rationing.","The race would not be held for four years (1942\u20131945).","The track was more or less abandoned during the war and fell into a state of disrepair.","Many of the locals conceded that the speedway would be sold after the war and become a housing development.","With the end of the war in sight, on November 29, 1944, three-time 500 winner Wilbur Shaw came back to do a 500-mile (800km) tire test approved by the government for Firestone.","Shaw was shocked at the dilapidated state of the speedway and contacted owner Eddie Rickenbacker, only to discover that it was for sale.","Shaw then sent out letters to the automobile industry to try to find a buyer.","All the responses indicated that the speedway would be turned into a private facility for the buyer.","Shaw then looked around for someone to buy the speedway, who would reopen the racetrack as a public venue.","He found Terre Haute businessman Tony Hulman.","Meetings were set up and the speedway was purchased on November 14, 1945.","Though not officially acknowledged, the purchase price for the speedway was reported by the Indianapolis Star and News to be $750,000.","Major renovations and repairs were made at a quick pace to the frail speedway, in time for the 1946 race.","Since the record 42 cars that started the 1933 edition of the 500, the field size has been set at 33 drivers, with only three exceptions to this rule, the first being 1947, when only 30 cars started due to a strike by certain teams affiliated with the ASPAR drivers, owners and sponsors association.","Since then the speedway has continued to grow.","Stands have been built and remodeled many times over, suites and museums were added, and many other additions helped bring back Indy's reputation as a great track.","In the 1950s, cars were topping out at 150mph (240km\/h), helping to draw more and more fans.","The low-slung, sleek cars were known as roadsters, and the Kurtis, Kuzma, and Watson chassis dominated the field.","Nearly all were powered by the Offenhauser, or \"Offy\", engines.","The crowd favorite Novi, with its unique sound and look, was the most powerful car of the decade that dominated time trials.","However, they would never make the full 500 miles (800km) in first place, often breaking down before the end or having to make too many pit stops because of the massive engine's thirst for fuel and the weight that went with the extra fuel.","The track's reputation improved so much that the 500-mile race became part of the Formula One World Championship for 10 years (1950\u20131960), even though none of the Indy drivers raced in Formula One and only Ferrari's Alberto Ascari of the F1 drivers at the time raced in the 500 in 1952.","Five-time world champion Juan Fangio practiced at the speedway in 1958 but ultimately decided against racing there.","The 1950s were also the most dangerous era of American racing.","Of the 33 drivers to qualify for the 1953 race, nearly half, 16, were to eventually die in racing accidents.","In October 1961, the final remaining brick sections of the track were paved over with asphalt, with the exception of a distinct three-foot-wide line of bricks at the start-finish line.","The \"Brickyard\" thus became known for its \"Yard of Bricks\".","After being widely ignored by Formula One drivers when it was an F1 World Championship event, a wave of F1 drivers went to the speedway in the 1960s, and the rear-engine revolution that was started by the Cooper F1 team changed the face of the 500 as well, with 1959 and 1960 world drivers' champion Jack Brabham of Australia qualifying his Cooper in 13th for the 1961 race.","The Cooper used a smaller (2.7-liter) and less powerful Coventry Climax engine compared to the 4.4-liter Offy engines used by the other 32 cars and was slower on the straights, but many took note of the British car's superior handling through the turns.","Brabham qualified 17th and after running as high as third, would ultimately finish ninth after completing all 200 laps.","Despite this, many doubters claimed the rear-engine cars were for drivers who liked to be pushed around, though as Brabham said \"It started the rear-engined revolution at Indy\".","A. J. Foyt, who had won his first 500 in 1961, won the 1964 Indianapolis 500, which was the last ever win for a front-engine car, and since Jim Clark's win driving the rear-engine Lotus 38 in 1965, every winner has driven a rear-engine car.","Graham Hill won the following year in his first attempt, eventually becoming the only driver to date to achieve auto racing's \"Triple Crown of Motorsport\" of winning the Monaco Grand Prix, Indianapolis 500, and Le Mans 24 Hours.","There were enough Americans to compete with them, with A.J.","Foyt, Mario Andretti, and the Unser brothers Bobby and Al leading the charge in the 1960s and 1970s, of whom Foyt and Al Unser would eventually become, respectively, the first two of four drivers, to date, to win four times each, while Bobby Unser won the race three times, with Andretti only ever winning the race once, in 1969.","Andretti would go on to race in F1 and win the world championship in 1978 with Team Lotus, who had been the first rear-engine winners at Indy, with Clark, in 1965.","From 1970 to 1981, Indianapolis had a twin in the city of Ontario, California, by the name of the Ontario Motor Speedway.","This track was known as the \"Indianapolis of the West\" and the home of the California 500, but was a financial failure due to poor management and not holding enough races on the racetrack.","In the 1977 Indy 500, Janet Guthrie made history when she became the first female driver to qualify for the race.","Guthrie started the race from 18th position but retired with timing gear failure after 27 laps.","She was eventually classified 29th.","1977 also saw A.J.","Foyt make history when he became the first driver to win the race four times.","1979 saw the second exception to the 1934 33-driver field rule.","By the late 1970s there arose some resistance from certain car owners and drivers as to the direction being taken by USAC, the auto racing sanctioning body that among other things, governed the Indianapolis 500 event.","Some of the dissident teams formed their own racing body, Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART).","USAC responded by barring six of the most famous teams in the sport from qualification (including Roger Penske and Dan Gurney), for \"undermining the well-being of USAC\".","The ruling would sideline former Indy winners Bobby Unser, Al Unser Sr., Gordon Johncock, and Johnny Rutherford.","After a court injunction in favor of CART, and a controversy where exhaust pipe rules were clarified after qualifications began and certain teams with an altered exhaust pipe were \"locked into\" the field, USAC held an additional qualification round on the day before the race, announcing that any driver who could post a faster speed than the slowest qualifier (Roger McCluskey) would be allowed to start the race.","Bill Vukovich and George Snider were added to the lineup, bringing the field to 35.","A crisis was averted for the moment, but USAC's handling of both issues was seen as bungling by some people, and as outright manipulation by others, and that year spelled the beginning of the end for USAC's governance of the Indy Car series.","The 1980s brought a new generation of speedsters, led by four-time race winner Rick Mears who also broke the 220mph (355km\/h) speed mark in qualifying (1989) and won six pole positions.","Other stars of the decade included Danny Sullivan, Bobby Rahal, and F1 veteran Emerson Fittipaldi.","The 1989 race came down to a final ten-lap, a thrilling duel between Fittipaldi and Al Unser Jr., culminating in Unser crashing in the third turn of the 199th lap after making contact with Fittpaldi's right front tire.","The early 1990s witnessed Arie Luyendyk winning in what was then the fastest 500 to date, with an average speed of 185.981mph (299.307km\/h).","That record was not eclipsed for almost a quarter of a century until Tony Kanaan won the 2013 race with an average speed of over 187mph (301km\/h).","Rick Mears became the third four-time winner after a late-race duel with Michael Andretti in 1991, and in 1992, Al Unser Jr. eked out a hard-fought victory by defeating last-place-starting driver Scott Goodyear by 0.043 of a second, a margin that is still the closest finish in race history.","The 500 got a new look in 1996 when it became an Indy Racing League event, formed as a rival to CART.","There was another qualifying controversy in 1996 and 1997, arising over the IRL's \"25\/8 rule\" which locked the previous year's top-25 overall points finishers into the Indianapolis race, regardless of their qualifying speed, leaving only eight spots open for entries to qualify on speed alone.","The rule effectively locked out the CART series regulars from competing for qualifying spots in the Indy 500.","CART responded by holding their own event, the U.S. 500, on the same day as the 1996 Indianapolis 500.","While the new qualifying format was not a factor in 1996, it would backfire in 1997 when two drivers who posted qualifying speeds fast enough to make the race were bumped to make room for slower locked-in cars with more 1996-97 championship points.","Hemelgarn Racing, who owned the two cars victimized in the scenario, protested to the IRL that the field would not include the 33 fastest cars.","After Bump Day was completed, the series elected to add the two bumped cars, driven by Johnny Unser and Lyn St. James, back into the field, bringing the number of starters to 35.","This marked the last time the 500's starting field has been larger than 33 drivers.","The early 2000s saw drivers from the rival CART series begin to cross over to compete at the Indianapolis 500.","In the 2000 Indianapolis 500, multiple CART champion team Chip Ganassi Racing brought their drivers Juan Pablo Montoya and Jimmy Vasser to Indianapolis.","Montoya qualified second, led 167 laps, and won the race convincingly, becoming the seventh Indy 500 rookie to win the race.","The next year, Team Penske made its return to the Indianapolis 500 after a five-year absence and was joined by Ganassi, Walker Racing and Michael Andretti, driving for Team Kool Green in a separate effort headed by Kim Green, known as \"Team Motorola\".","For the second straight year, an Indy rookie won the race as H\u00e9lio Castroneves took the checkered flag.","Roger Penske then elected to move his entire operation over to the IRL beginning in 2002, taking Castroneves and teammate Gil de Ferran with him.","After fielding one car in 2002, Ganassi Racing followed Penske to the IRL full-time for the 2003 season.","Michael Andretti, who had left his long-time ride at Newman-Haas Racing because he wanted to run the Indianapolis 500 again (something they were not willing to do), bought a majority interest in CART's Team Green, which returned to Indianapolis in 2002 with Dario Franchitti, Paul Tracy and Michael Andretti, and moved it to the IRL that same year as Andretti Green Racing, and in 2004 former CART champion Bobby Rahal's operation moved to the IRL as Rahal Letterman Racing.","Castroneves repeated his Indianapolis 500 win in 2002 despite controversial circumstances involving a late-race caution and a pass made by Tracy, and his teammate de Ferran won in 2003.","In 2003, the Indy Lights Series, a minor league series to the IndyCar Series, made history with the first May race at the track since 1910, other than the 500.","The Freedom 100, first held during the final qualifying weekend, has been moved to \"carburetion day\" on the Friday before the 500.","From 2005 to 2007, the Indy Lights became the first racing series since 1916 to run at the racecourse twice in one year.","The first event being the Freedom 100, held on the oval track as part of the Indianapolis 500 weekend, and the second event, the Liberty Challenge, during the United States Grand Prix weekend, competing on the Grand Prix road course.","Buddy Rice became the first American driver since 1998 to win the race in the rain-shortened 2004 Indianapolis 500.","At the time, Rice drove for the team co-owned by 1986 Indianapolis 500 winner Bobby Rahal and the Indiana native television talk show host and comedian David Letterman.","In 2005, Danica Patrick became the first female driver to lead the race at Indianapolis, after acquiring it for a lap near the 125-mile (200km) mark while cycling through pit stops.","Dan Wheldon would go on to win the 2005 Indianapolis 500.","Sam Hornish Jr. became the first driver to ever overtake for the lead on the race's final lap, ultimately winning the 2006 Indianapolis 500 in the last 450 feet (140m) by a 0.0635-second margin over rookie Marco Andretti.","Dario Franchitti became the first native of Scotland since Jim Clark's victory in 1965 to win, in the rain-shortened 2007 Indianapolis 500.","In mid-February 2008, Champ Car filed for bankruptcy.","In late February, an agreement was reached for Champ Car to be merged with the IRL, and the first IRL IndyCar Series season since the unification took place in 2008.","Scott Dixon, driving for Chip Ganassi Racing, became the first native of New Zealand to win, in the 2008 Indianapolis 500.","In the 100th anniversary year of the construction of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, H\u00e9lio Castroneves became the sixth three-time winner of the 500 in the 2009 Indianapolis 500.","Danica Patrick also had her best finish ever (third place) in the race, also the best finish ever by a woman in the history of the Indianapolis 500.","The 2010, 2011 and 2012 runnings of the race saw three consecutive British victories, namely for previous winners Franchitti (2010 and 2012) and the late Wheldon winning in 2011 just a few months before his fatal crash at Las Vegas.","Brazilian Tony Kanaan won the 2013 running, before American Ryan Hunter-Reay ended an eight-year streak of foreign winners in 2014.","Previous winner Montoya had returned to IndyCar competition and secured a 2015 win to make himself a two-time winner with a fifteen-year gap between triumphs.","The event saw Canadian James Hinchcliffe survive a life-threatening impact in practice.","The 2016 race saw another American race winner when rookie Alexander Rossi stretched his fuel mileage to record an upset win in a race where he had been off the leaders' pace.","The 2017 race saw former Formula One World Champion Fernando Alonso take off from the Monaco Grand Prix to take part in a one-off event, being highly competitive up front before his engine blew.","The races' polesitter and 2008 winner Scott Dixon escaped a huge airborne crash largely unhurt.","In spite of heavy crashes, the speedway had now gone more than 20 years without a fatality as the SAFER barriers and the enhanced IndyCars absorbed more of the violent impacts.","The race was eventually won by Takuma Sato, who became the first Japanese and Asian winner of the event.","In 2018, Australian former series' champions Will Power won the race after a decade of participation as the first Australian to win the 500, whereas his Penske teammate Simon Pagenaud repeated that feat, becoming the first French winner of the race since 1920, in 2019 after a last-lap duel with 2016 winner Rossi.","In 2020, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, as with IndyCar Series and other related holdings, was sold to Penske Entertainment Corp., a subsidiary of the Penske Corporation, owned by Roger Penske.","In 2020, for the first time Indianapolis 500 was not held on or around Memorial Day in late May and instead was held in August.","Japanese 2017 winner's Takuma Sato won the race for the second time after taking lead at lap 186.","In 2021, Brazilian three-time winner H\u00e9lio Castroneves won the race after a late-race duel with \u00c1lex Palou, he joined A. J. Foyt, Al Unser Sr. and Rick Mears as four-time winners, this race was also the first victory for Meyer Shank Racing.","From 1919 to 1993, the Indianapolis 500 was the only sanctioned race held at the Speedway.","When Tony George (Hulman's grandson) inherited the track, he spearheaded an effort to bring more racing events to the track.","In August 1994, the Brickyard 400 for the NASCAR Winston Cup Series made its debut, and at the time, featured the largest crowd and largest cash purse in NASCAR history.","From 1998 to 2003, an IROC event was held as a support race.","Since 2012, the Cup race has been supported by the Pennzoil 150 of the NASCAR Xfinity Series; in 2020, the race was moved to the infield road course.","The Cup race followed suit in 2021 and was renamed the Verizon 200.","Known for a time as Kroger Super Weekend, it also previously hosted the Brickyard Grand Prix for the TUDOR United Sports Car Championship on the infield road course.","In 1998, Tony George arranged for Formula One to return to the United States for the first time since 1991.","A two-year renovation and construction project added an infield road course and culminated in the first United States Grand Prix at the facility in 2000.","With over 200,000 spectators in attendance, it was one of the largest crowds in the history of Formula One and considered a huge success.","The race was also pivotal to Michael Schumacher's winning of the 2000 World Championship, as he came out on top while Mika H\u00e4kkinen's engine blew, resulting in an eight-point lead of the championship that set Schumacher up for needing only one win in the remaining two races, something he achieved at the next event.","The short history of the event, however, was littered with controversies.","The 2002 United States Grand Prix was marred by a bizarre ending, in which Michael Schumacher, having already clinched the championship, seemingly tried to stage a dead heat with teammate Rubens Barrichello.","The official timings showed Barrichello ahead by 0.011 seconds at the line, leading fans and media to dub the event a farce.","The 2002 race was also the first-ever Formula One race to use SAFER barriers.","In 2003 Schumacher once more set himself up for the title with an Indianapolis win in a dramatic wet-dry event.","The 2005 race turned out to be one of the most controversial races in motorsport history.","Michelin realized their tires were ill-equipped for the banking after two heavy crashes for Toyota both for Ralf Schumacher and stand-in Ricardo Zonta, and at the last second, the Michelin teams pulled into the pits at the end of the formation lap, leaving only the three Bridgestone teams (six cars) to contest the race.","Fans and media were highly critical of the poor handling of the situation.","Many fans walked out, and costly ticket refunds were issued.","The 2005 event was not the first tire issue for Michelin as Ralf Schumacher also had heavily crashed, fracturing his back in the 2004 race, while Fernando Alonso also suffered a tire blowout at the end of the start-finish straight in that same event.","Despite the outrage of the 2005 event, the race returned for two additional years.","The race did not enjoy the level of success of its earlier runnings, and attendance and interest fell dramatically.","The race was left off the calendar for 2008, and efforts to revive the race for 2009 were not successful.","In 2012, the U.S. Grand Prix relocated to the Circuit of the Americas.","From 2008 to 2015, the speedway hosted a round of Grand Prix motorcycle racing.","The race marked the first motorcycle racing event at the facility since 1909.","Modifications approved by the FIA and FIM were made to the combined road course, bringing the new layout to a total of 16 turns.","The motorcycle course was designed to run counter-clockwise, the same direction as the oval events.","The banking of oval turn one was bypassed by a new infield section, dubbed the \"Snake Pit Complex\".","In addition, the double-hairpin after the Hulman Straight was replaced with traditional esses.","On September 12, 2019, the Speedway announced motorcycle racing will return on the FIM-approved circuit with the MotoAmerica Championship of Indianapolis, which will be part of the Motorcycles on Meridian motorcycle festival.","The Indianapolis festival will join Sturgis Motorcycle Rally (American Flat Track) and Daytona Beach Bike Week (Daytona 200 American Sportbike Racing Association championship) as hosts of major motorcycle racing events that run with motorcycle festivals.","It will mark MotoAmerica's first race at the Speedway since 2015, and the first as a stand-alone race with the five major championships participating.","Beginning in 2014, the IndyCar Series began holding a race on the combined road course in early May, serving as a lead-in to the Indianapolis 500.","The infield road course was modified once again, to make the circuit more competitive, better for fans, and more suited for Indy cars.","The Brickyard Vintage Racing Invitational, held in mid-June, is a racing meet for vintage racing, held on the road course.","The event is sanctioned by the Sportscar Vintage Racing Association.","In addition to multiple classes of racing on the road course, oval track exhibitions featuring historical Indy cars have also been part of the event.","The feature event of the weekend is the annual Indy Legends Charity Pro\u2013Am race.","In October 2021 the IMS was the location for the first race with full autonomous racecars as a successor of the DARPA Grand Challenge.","University teams from all over the world competed in developing software for high speed autonomous driving on the IMS oval.","All teams were using a Dallara Indy Lights vehicle equipped with sensors (lidar, radar, camera) and computation hardware.","The teams development a full autonomous driving software stack that enables perception, planning and control on the racetrack.","The competition was won by the team \"TUM Autonomous Motorsport\" from the Technical University of Munich which was awarded a prize money of $1,000,000 USD.","From 1960 to 1968, the Speedway Golf Course hosted a PGA Tour event, the 500 Festival Open Invitation; its earlier editions were held during the days surrounding the Indy 500 race week.","In 1968, it also held an LPGA tournament, the 500 Ladies Classic in mid-June, won by Mickey Wright.","A reconstruction project was completed in 1993, converting the 27-hole layout (18 holes outside, nine in the infield) to an 18-hole championship course designed by legendary golf architect Pete Dye.","Renamed \"Brickyard Crossing,\" it features 14 holes outside, and four holes in the infield, with an infield lake.","At par 72, it measures 7,180 yards (6,565m) from the back tees with a course rating of 75.1 and a slope of 149.","A senior tour event, the Brickyard Crossing Championship, was played there from 1994 through 2000, and it has also hosted college tournaments.","An LPGA event, Indy Women in Tech Championship, debuted in 2017.","The opening of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1909 dates back close to the birth of the sport of American Championship car racing.","Since its inception, the Speedway has been metonymous within the sport.","Many Indy car teams, suppliers, and constructors have been and are based in the greater Indianapolis area, some within blocks of the track.","When USAC was formed in 1956, the sanctioning body's headquarters were constructed nearly across the street.","The current sanctioning body, IndyCar, is headquartered in buildings directly across the street.","The track, and occasionally the headquarters, is sometimes referred to as \"16th & Georgetown\", owing to the track's address at the corner of 16th Street and Georgetown Road, and particularly the administration building's physical location at the corner of that intersection (which is now a roundabout).","The Speedway and the city of Indianapolis are closely tied to Indy car racing, analogous to the link NASCAR has to the greater Charlotte area.","The term \"Indy\" and its variations synonymous with motorsports (\"Indy 500\", \"Indy car,\" etc.)","derive directly from the shorthand nickname (\"Indy\") of the city (\"Indianapolis\") itself.","In 2004, The Indianapolis Star journalist Curt Cavin counted 257,325 seats, a world record.","The number of seats was reduced to an estimated 235,000 in 2013.","The Indianapolis Motor Speedway appeared in the 2013 DreamWorks Animation animated film Turbo.","Indianapolis Motor Speedway has a transitional climate with influences of both subtropical and continental.","The nearest official weather station is at the Indianapolis International Airport, located just a few miles from the speedway.","Due to the cold winters, including snow on the track, Indy 500 testing is often impossible during winter months.","During the main event in late May, the local climate is transitioning from spring to summer.","May is the rainiest month of the year, which makes rain delays a large risk during various parts of the event.","Ambient temperatures on average for the month is in the lower 70s Fahrenheit\/lower 20s Celsius, with temperatures in the 80s not being uncommon later in the month when the race takes place.","For the Brickyard 400 in the summer, the track is much more prone to heatwaves, with the wet season carrying on into July as well.","The defunct Formula One and MotoGP roval infield road course events ran in June\/September and August respectively.","Since oval racing is not conducted in wet conditions, the inaugural Formula One Grand Prix became the track's first race under wet conditions, using the oval's Turn 1 in a reverse direction with rain tires.","The IndyCar Grand Prix, which is usually run two weeks before the 500, is the main existing road course event and can be run in wet conditions, as can the NASCAR meeting Shell 150 and Verizon 200."]},{"category":"Circuit","circuitId":20,"name":"N\u00fcrburgring","location":"N\u00fcrburg","country":"Germany","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/N%C3%BCrburgring","circuit_text":["The N\u00fcrburgring is a 150,000 person capacity motorsports complex located in the town of N\u00fcrburg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.","It features a Grand Prix race track built in 1984, and a much longer Nordschleife \"North loop\" track which was built in the 1920s around the village and medieval castle of N\u00fcrburg in the Eifel mountains.","The north loop is 20.8km (12.9mi) long and has more than 300 metres (1,000 feet) of elevation change from its lowest to highest points.","Jackie Stewart nicknamed the old track \"The Green Hell\".","Originally, the track featured four configurations: the 28.265km (17.563mi)-long Gesamtstrecke (\"Whole Course\"), which in turn consisted of the 22.810km (14.173mi) Nordschleife (\"North Loop\"), and the 7.747km (4.814mi) S\u00fcdschleife (\"South Loop\").","There was also a 2.281km (1.417mi) warm-up loop called Zielschleife (\"Finish Loop\") or Betonschleife (\"Concrete Loop\"), around the pit area.","Between 1982 and 1983 the start\/finish area was demolished to create a new GP-Strecke, and this is used for all major and international racing events.","However, the shortened Nordschleife is still in use for racing, testing and public access.","In 1907, the first Eifelrennen race was held on the one-off Taunus circuit, a 117km (73mi) made up of public roads starting between the towns of Wehrheim and Saalburg just north of Frankfurt.","In the early 1920s, ADAC Eifelrennen races were held on the twisty 33.2km (20.6mi) Nideggen public road circuit near Cologne and Bonn.","Around 1925, the construction of a dedicated race track was proposed just south of the Nideggen circuit around the ancient castle of the town of N\u00fcrburg, following the examples of Italy's Monza and Targa Florio courses, and Berlin's AVUS, yet with a different character.","The layout of the circuit in the mountains was similar to the Targa Florio event, one of the most important motor races at that time.","The original N\u00fcrburgring was to be a showcase for German automotive engineering and racing talent.","Construction of the track, designed by the Eichler Architekturb\u00fcro from Ravensburg (led by architect Gustav Eichler), began in September 1925.","The track was completed in spring of 1927, and the ADAC Eifelrennen races were continued there.","The first races to take place on 18 June 1927 showed motorcycles and sidecars.","The first motorcycle race was won by Toni Ulmen on an English 350 cc Velocette.","The cars followed a day later, and Rudolf Caracciola was the winner of the over 5000 cc class in a Mercedes-Benz Compressor.","In addition, the track was opened to the public in the evenings and on weekends, as a one-way toll road.","The whole track consisted of 174 bends (prior to 1971 changes), and averaged 8 to 9 metres (26 to 30ft) in width.","The fastest time ever around the full Gesamtstrecke was by Louis Chiron, at an average speed of 112.31km\/h (72mph) in his Bugatti.","In 1929 the full N\u00fcrburgring was used for the last time in major racing events, as future Grands Prix would be held only on the Nordschleife.","Motorcycles and minor races primarily used the shorter and safer S\u00fcdschleife.","Memorable pre-war races at the circuit featured the talents of early Ringmeister (Ringmasters) such as Rudolf Caracciola, Tazio Nuvolari and Bernd Rosemeyer.","After World War II, racing resumed in 1947 and in 1951, the Nordschleife of the N\u00fcrburgring again became the main venue for the German Grand Prix as part of the Formula One World Championship (with the exception of 1959, when it was held on the AVUS in Berlin).","A new group of Ringmeister arose to dominate the race \u2013 Alberto Ascari, Juan Manuel Fangio, Stirling Moss, Jim Clark, John Surtees, Jackie Stewart and Jacky Ickx.","On 5 August 1961, during practice for the 1961 German Grand Prix, Phil Hill became the first person to complete a lap of the Nordschleife in under 9 minutes, with a lap of 8 minutes 55.2 seconds (153.4km\/h or 95.3mph) in the Ferrari 156 \"Sharknose\" Formula One car.","Over half a century later, even the highest performing road cars still have difficulty breaking 8 minutes without a professional race driver or one very familiar with the track.","Also, several rounds of the German motorcycle Grand Prix were held, mostly on the 7.7km (4.8mi) S\u00fcdschleife, but the Hockenheimring and the Solitudering were the main sites for Grand Prix motorcycle racing.","In 1953, the ADAC 1000 km N\u00fcrburgring race was introduced, an Endurance race and Sports car racing event that counted towards the World Sportscar Championship for decades.","The 24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring for touring car racing was added in 1970.","By the late 1960s, the Nordschleife and many other tracks were becoming increasingly dangerous for the latest generation of F1 cars.","In 1967, a chicane was added before the start\/finish straight, called Hohenrain, in order to reduce speeds at the pit lane entry.","This made the track 25m (82ft) longer.","Even this change, however, was not enough to keep Stewart from nicknaming it \"The Green Hell\" (German: Die Gr\u00fcne H\u00f6lle) following his victory in the 1968 German Grand Prix amid a driving rainstorm and thick fog.","In 1970, after the fatal crash of Piers Courage at Zandvoort, the F1 drivers decided at the French Grand Prix to boycott the N\u00fcrburgring unless major changes were made, as they did at Spa the year before.","The changes were not possible on short notice, and the German GP was moved to the Hockenheimring, which had already been modified.","In accordance with the demands of the F1 drivers, the Nordschleife was reconstructed by taking out some bumps, smoothing out some sudden jumps (particularly at Br\u00fcnnchen), and installing Armco safety barriers.","The track was made straighter, following the race line, which reduced the number of corners.","The German GP could be hosted at the N\u00fcrburgring again, and was for another six years from 1971 to 1976.","In 1973 the entrance into the dangerous and bumpy Kallenhard corner was made slower by adding another left-hand corner after the fast Metzgesfeld sweeping corner.","Safety was improved again later on by removing the jumps on the long main straight and widening it, and taking away the bushes right next to the track at the main straight, which had made that section of the N\u00fcrburgring dangerously narrow.","A second series of three more F1 races was held until 1976.","However, primarily due to its length of over 22 kilometres (14mi), and the lack of space due to its situation on the sides of the mountains, increasing demands by the F1 drivers and the FIA's CSI commission were too expensive or impossible to meet.","For instance, by the 1970s the German Grand Prix required five times the marshals and medical staff as a typical F1 race, something the German organizers were unwilling to provide.","Additionally, even with the 1971 modifications it was still possible for cars to become airborne off the track.","The N\u00fcrburgring was also unsuitable for the burgeoning television market; its vast expanse made it almost impossible to effectively cover a race there.","As a result, early in the season it was decided that the 1976 race would be the last to be held on the old circuit.","Niki Lauda, the reigning world champion and only person ever to lap the full 22,835-metre (14.189mi) Nordschleife in under seven minutes (6:58.6, 1975), proposed to the other drivers that they boycott the circuit in 1976.","Lauda was not only concerned about the safety arrangements and the lack of marshals around the circuit, he also did not like the prospect of running the race in another rainstorm.","Usually when that happened, some parts of the circuit were wet and other parts were dry, which is what the conditions of the circuit were for that race.","The other drivers voted against the idea and the race went ahead.","Lauda crashed in his Ferrari coming out of the left-hand kink before Bergwerk after a new magnesium component on his Ferrari's rear suspension failed.","He was badly burned as his car was still loaded with fuel in lap 2.","Lauda was saved by the combined actions of fellow drivers Arturo Merzario, Guy Edwards, Brett Lunger, and Harald Ertl.","The crash also showed that the track's distances were too long for regular fire engines and ambulances, even though the \"ONS-Staffel\" was equipped with a Porsche 911 rescue car, marked (R).","The old N\u00fcrburgring never hosted another F1 race again, as the German Grand Prix was moved to the Hockenheimring for 1977.","The German motorcycle Grand Prix was held for the last time on the old N\u00fcrburgring in 1980, also permanently moving to Hockenheim.","By its very nature, the Nordschleife was impossible to make safe in its old configuration.","It soon became apparent that it would have to be completely overhauled if there was any prospect of Formula One returning there- the N\u00fcrburgring's administration and race organizers were not willing to provide the enormous expense of providing the number of marshals needed for a Grand Prix- up to six times the amount that most other circuits needed.","With this in mind, in 1981 work began on a 4.5km (2.8mi)-long new circuit, which was built on and around the old pit area.","At the same time, a bypass shortened the Nordschleife to 20,832m (12.944mi), and with an additional small pit lane, this version was used for races in 1983, e.g.","the 1000km N\u00fcrburgring endurance race, while construction work was going on nearby.","During qualifying for that race, the late Stefan Bellof set a lap of 6:11.13 for the 20.8km (12.9mi) Nordschleife in his Porsche 956, or 199.8km\/h (124.1mph) on average.","This lap held the all-time record for 35 years (partially because no major racing has taken place there since 1984) until it was surpassed by Timo Bernhard in the Porsche 919 Hybrid Evo, which ran the slightly longer version of the circuit in 5:19.546- averaging 233.8km\/h (145.3mph) on 29 June 2018.","Meanwhile, more run-off areas were added at corners like Aremberg and Br\u00fcnnchen, where originally there were just embankments protected by Armco barriers.","The track surface was made safer in some spots where there had been nasty bumps and jumps.","Racing line markers were added to the corners all around the track as well.","Also, bushes and hedges at the edges of corners were taken out and replaced with Armco and grass.","The former S\u00fcdschleife had not been modified in 1970\/71 and was abandoned a few years later in favour of the improved Nordschleife.","It is now mostly gone (in part due to the construction of the new circuit) or converted to a normal public road, but since 2005 a vintage car event has been hosted on the old track layout, including part of the parking area.","The new track was completed in 1984 and named GP-Strecke (German: Gro\u00dfer Preis-Strecke: literally, \"Grand Prix Course\").","It was built to meet the highest safety standards.","However, it was considered in character a mere shadow of its older sibling.","Some fans, who had to sit much farther away from the track, called it Eifelring, Ersatzring, Gr\u00fcnering or similar nicknames, believing it did not deserve to be called N\u00fcrburgring.","Like many circuits of the time, it offered few overtaking opportunities.","To celebrate its opening, an exhibition race was held on 12 May.","The 1984 N\u00fcrburgring Race of Champions featured an array of notable drivers driving identical Mercedes 190E 2.3\u201316's: the line-up was Elio de Angelis, Jack Brabham (Formula 1 World Champion 1959, 1960, 1966), Phil Hill (1961), Denis Hulme (1967), James Hunt (1976), Alan Jones (1980), Jacques Laffite, Niki Lauda (1975, 1977)*, Stirling Moss, Alain Prost*, Carlos Reutemann, Keke Rosberg (1982), Jody Scheckter (1979), Ayrton Senna*, John Surtees (1964) and John Watson.","[Drivers marked with * won the Formula 1 World Championship subsequent to the race].","Senna won ahead of Lauda, Reutemann, Rosberg, Watson, Hulme and Jody Scheckter, being the only one to resist Lauda's performance who \u2013 having missed the qualifying \u2013 had to start from the last row and overtook all the others except Senna.","There were nine former and two future Formula 1 World Champions competing, in a field of 20 cars with 16 Formula 1 drivers; the other four were local drivers: Klaus Ludwig, Manfred Schurti, Udo Sch\u00fctz and Hans Herrmann.","Besides other major international events, the N\u00fcrburgring has seen the brief return of Formula One racing, as the 1984 European Grand Prix was held at the track, followed by the 1985 German Grand Prix.","As F1 did not stay, other events were the highlights at the new N\u00fcrburgring, including the 1000km N\u00fcrburgring, DTM, motorcycles, and newer types of events, like truck racing, vintage car racing at the AvD \"Oldtimer Grand Prix\", and even the \"Rock am Ring\" concerts.","Following the success and first world championship of Michael Schumacher, a second German F1 race was held at the N\u00fcrburgring between 1995 and 2006, called the European Grand Prix, or in 1997 and 1998, the Luxembourg Grand Prix.","For 2002, the track was changed, by replacing the former \"Castrol-chicane\" at the end of the start\/finish straight with a sharp right-hander (nicknamed \"Haug-Hook\"), in order to create an overtaking opportunity.","Also, a slow Omega-shaped section was inserted, on the site of the former kart track.","This extended the GP track from 4,500 to 5,200m (2.80 to 3.23mi), while at the same time, the Hockenheimring was shortened from 6,800 to 4,500m (4.23 to 2.80mi).","Both the N\u00fcrburgring and the Hockenheimring events have been losing money due to high and rising Formula One license fees charged by Bernie Ecclestone and low attendance due to high ticket prices; starting with the 2007 Formula One season, Hockenheim and N\u00fcrburgring alternated in hosting the German GP.","In Formula One, Ralf Schumacher collided with his teammate Giancarlo Fisichella and his brother at the start of the 1997 race which was won by Jacques Villeneuve.","In 1999, in changing conditions, Johnny Herbert managed to score the only win for the team of former Ringmeister Jackie Stewart.","One of the highlights of the 2005 season was Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen's spectacular exit while in the last lap of the race, when his suspension gave way after being rattled lap after lap by a flat-spotted tyre that was not changed due to the short-lived 'one set of tyres' rule.","Prior to the 2007 European Grand Prix, the Audi S (turns 8 and 9) was renamed Michael Schumacher S after Michael Schumacher.","Schumacher had retired from Formula One the year before, but returned in 2010, and in 2011 became the second Formula One driver to drive through a turn named after them (after Ayrton Senna driving his \"S for Senna\" at Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace).","In 2007, the FIA announced that Hockenheimring and N\u00fcrburgring would alternate with the German Grand Prix with N\u00fcrburgring hosting in 2007.","Due to name-licensing problems, it was held as the European Grand Prix that year.","In 2014, the new owners of the N\u00fcrburgring were unable to secure a deal to continue hosting the German Grand Prix in the odd-numbered years, so the 2015 and 2017 German Grands Prix were cancelled.","In July 2020, it was announced that after seven years, the race track would be an official Formula One Grand Prix with the event taking place from 9 to 11 October 2020.","This race was called the Eifel Grand Prix in honour of the nearby mountain range, meaning the venue held a Grand Prix under a fourth different name having hosted races under the German, European and Luxembourg Grands Prix titles previously.","That race was won by Lewis Hamilton, who equalled Michael Schumacher's record of wins.","While it is unusual for deaths to occur during sanctioned races, there are many accidents and several deaths each year during public sessions.","It is common for the track to be closed several times a day for cleanup, repair, and medical intervention.","While track management does not publish any official figures, several regular visitors to the track have used police reports to estimate the number of fatalities as between 3 and 12 in a full year.","Jeremy Clarkson noted in Top Gear in 2004 that \"over the years this track has claimed over 200 lives\".","Several touring car series still compete on the Nordschleife, using either only the simple 20.8km (12.9mi) version with its separate small pit lane, or a combined 24.4km (15.2mi)-long track that uses a part of the original modern F1 track (without the Mercedes Arena section, which is often used for support pits) plus its huge pit facilities.","Entry-level competition requires a regularity test (GLP) for street-legal cars.","Two racing series (RCN\/CHC and VLN) compete on 15 Saturdays each year, for several hours.","The annual highlight is the 24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring weekend, held usually in mid-May, featuring 220 cars \u2013 from small 100hp (75kW) cars to 700hp (520kW) Turbo Porsches or 500hp (370kW) factory race cars built by BMW, Opel, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz, over 700 drivers (amateurs and professionals), and up to 290,000 spectators.","As of 2015 the World Touring Car Championship holds the FIA WTCC Race of Germany at the Nordschleife as a support category to the 24 Hours.","Automotive media outlets and manufacturers use the Nordschleife as a standard to publish their lap times achieved with their production vehicles.","BMW Sauber\u2019s Nick Heidfeld made history on 28 April 2007 as the first driver in over thirty years to tackle the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife track in a contemporary Formula One car.","Heidfeld's three laps in an F1.06 were part of festivities celebrating BMW's contribution to motorsport.","About 45,000 spectators showed up for the main event, the third four-hour VLN race of the season.","Conceived largely as a photo opportunity, the lap times were not as fast as the car was capable of, BMW instead choosing to run the chassis at a particularly high ride height to allow for the Nordschleife's abrupt gradient changes and to limit maximum speeds accordingly.","Former F1 driver Hans-Joachim Stuck was injured during the race when he crashed his BMW Z4.","As part of the festivities before the 2013 24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring race, Michael Schumacher and other Mercedes-Benz drivers took part in a promotional event which saw Schumacher complete a demonstration lap of the Nordschleife at the wheel of a 2011 Mercedes W02.","As with Heidfeld's lap, and also partly due to Formula One's strict in-season testing bans, the lap left many motorsport fans underwhelmed.","Since its opening in 1927, the track has been used by the public for the so-called Touristenfahrten: anyone with a road-legal car or motorcycle, as well as tour buses, motor homes, or cars with trailers, are able to access the Nordschleife.","It is opened every day of the week, except when races take place.","The track may be closed for weeks during the winter months, depending on weather conditions and maintenance work.","Passing on the right is prohibited, and some sections have speed limits; the normal traffic rules (StVO in German) apply also here.","The N\u00fcrburgring is a popular attraction for many driving enthusiasts and riders from all over the world, partly because of its history and the challenge it provides.","The lack of oncoming traffic and intersections sets it apart from regular roads, and the absence of a blanket speed limit is a further attraction.","Normal ticket buyers on tourist days cannot quite complete a full lap of the 20.8km (12.9mi) Nordschleife, which bypasses the modern GP-Strecke, as they are required to slow down and pass through a 200-metre (220yd) \"pit lane\" section where toll gates are installed.","On busier days, a mobile ticket barrier is installed on the main straight in order to reduce the length of queues at the fixed barriers.","This is open to all ticket holders.","On rare occasions, it is possible to drive both the Nordschleife and the Grand Prix circuit combined.","Drivers interested in lap times often time themselves from the first bridge after the barriers to the last gantry (aka Bridge-to-Gantry or BTG time) before the exit.","However, the track's general conditions state that any form of racing, including speed record attempts, is forbidden.","The driver's insurance coverage may consequently be voided, leaving the driver fully liable for damage.","Normal, non-racing, non-timed driving accidents might be covered by driver's insurance, but it is increasingly common for insurers to insert exclusion clauses that mean drivers and riders on the N\u00fcrburgring only have third-party coverage or are not covered at all.","Drivers who have crashed into the barriers, suffered mechanical failure or been otherwise required to be towed off track during Touristenfahrten sessions are referred to as having joined the \"Bongard Club\".","This nickname is derived from the name of the company which operates the large yellow recovery flatbed trucks which ferry those unfortunate drivers and their vehicles to the nearest exit.","Due to the high volume of traffic, there is an emphasis on quickly clearing and repairing any compromised safety measures so the track can be immediately re-opened for use.","Additionally, those found responsible for damage to the track or safety barriers are required to pay for repairs, along with the time and cost associated with personnel and equipment to address those damages, making any accident or breakdown a potentially expensive incident.","Because it is technically operated as a public toll road, failing to report an accident or instance where track surfaces are affected is considered unlawfully leaving the scene of an accident.","This is all part of the rules and regulations which aim to ensure a safe experience for all visitors to the track.","The entire N\u00fcrburgring Gesamtstrecke was open to the public from its initial opening.","At several points around the circuit there were access roads and toll points from which drivers and riders could begin or end a drive.","The S\u00fcdschleife had one of these at the bottom of the uphill stretch near M\u00fcllenbach.","One of the original purposes of the Nordschleife was as a test track for auto manufacturers, and its demanding layout had been traditionally used as a proving ground.","Weekdays are often booked for so-called Industriefahrten for auto makers and the media.","With the advent of the Internet, awareness of the Nordschleife has risen in Germany and abroad, in addition to publicity in print media.","In 1999, Porsche reported that their new 996 GT3 had lapped the N\u00fcrburgring in under eight minutes, and in subsequent years, manufacturers from overseas also showed up to test cars.","Some high-performance models are promoted with videotaped laps published on the web, and the claimed lap times generate discussion.","Few of these supercars are actually entered in racing where the claims could be backed up.","For sixteen weeks per year, the industry pool (Industrie-Pool) rents exclusive daytime use of the track for automotive development, and endurance testing.","As of 2017 the industry pool consisted of approximately 30 car manufacturers, associations, and component suppliers.","By 2019, the track was being rented by the industry pool for 18 weeks per year.","The TV Series Top Gear has also used the Nordschleife for its challenges, often involving Sabine Schmitz.","In addition, during series 17 (summer 2011) of Top Gear, James May was very critical of the ride quality of cars whose development processes included testing on the Nordschleife, saying that cars which were tested at Nordschleife got ruined.","Multiple layouts of the N\u00fcrburgring have been featured in video games, such as the Gran Turismo series, the Forza Motorsport series, the Need for Speed: Shift series, iRacing and Assetto Corsa.","Grand Prix Legends, a historic racing simulator also included the N\u00fcrburgring on its roster of default Grand Prix tracks.","Other pastimes are hosted at the N\u00fcrburgring, such as the Rock am Ring, Germany's biggest rock music festival, attracting close to 100,000 rock fans each year since 1985.","Since 1978, the Nordschleife is also the venue of a major running event (N\u00fcrburgring-Lauf\/Run am Ring).","In 2003, a major bicycling event (Rad am Ring) was added and it became the multi-sports event Rad & Run am Ring.","In 2009, new commercial areas opened, including a hotel and shopping mall.","In the summer of 2009, ETF Ride Systems opened a new interactive dark ride application called \"Motor Mania\" at the racetrack, in collaboration with Lagotronics B.V.","The roller coaster \"ring\u00b0racer\" was scheduled to open in 2011 however was delayed significantly due to technical issues.","It eventually opened October 31st 2013 however closed after just 4 days of operation on November 3rd.","In 2012, the track was preparing to file for bankruptcy as a result of nearly $500 million in debts and the inability to secure financing.","On 1 August 2012, the government of Rheinland-Pfalz guaranteed $312 million to allow the track to meet its debt obligations.","In 2013, the N\u00fcrburgring was for sale for US$165 million (\u20ac127.3 million).","The sale process was by sealed-bid auction with an expected completion date of \"Late Summer\".","This meant there was to be a new owner in 2013, unencumbered by the debts of the previous operation, with the circuit expected to return to profitability.","On 11 March 2014 it was reported that the N\u00fcrburgring was sold for 77 million euros ($106.8 million).","D\u00fcsseldorf-based Capricorn Development was the buyer.","The company was to take full ownership of the N\u00fcrburgring on 1 January 2015.","But in October 2014, Russian billionaire, the chairman of Moscow-based Pharmstandard, Viktor Kharitonin, bought a majority stake in the N\u00fcrburgring.","In May 2015, the N\u00fcrburgring was set to hold the first Gr\u00fcne H\u00f6lle Rock festival as a replacement for the Rock am Ring festival, but the project did not take place.","Gr\u00fcne H\u00f6lle Rock changed their name to Rock im Revier and the event was held in the Schalke area.","The Nordschleife operates in a clockwise direction, and was formerly known for its abundance of sharp crests, causing fast-moving, firmly-sprung racing cars to jump clear off the track surface at many locations.","Although by no means the most fearsome, Flugplatz is perhaps the most aptly (although coincidentally) named and widely remembered.","The name of this part of the track comes from a small airfield, which in the early years was located close to the track in this area.","The track features a very short straight that climbs sharply uphill for a short time, then suddenly drops slightly downhill, and this is immediately followed by two very fast right-hand kinks.","Chris Irwin's career was ended following a massive accident at Flugplatz, in a Ford 3L GT sports car in 1968.","Manfred Winkelhock flipped his March Formula Two car at the same corner in 1980.","This section of the track was renovated in 2016 after an accident in which a Nissan GTR flew over the fence and killed a spectator.","The Flugplatz is one of the most important parts of the N\u00fcrburgring because after the two very fast right-handers comes what is possibly the fastest part of the track: a downhill straight called Kottenborn, into a very fast curve called Schwedenkreuz (Swedish Cross).","Drivers are flat out for some time here.","Right before Flugplatz is Quiddelbacher-H\u00f6he (peak, as in \"mountain summit\"), where the track crosses a bridge over the Bundesstra\u00dfe 257.","The Fuchsr\u00f6hre is soon after the very fast downhill section succeeding the Flugplatz.","After negotiating a long right-hand corner called Aremberg (which is after Schwedenkreuz) the road goes slightly uphill, under a bridge and then it plunges downhill, and the road switches back left and right and finding a point of reference for the racing line is difficult.","This whole sequence is flat out and then, the road climbs sharply uphill.","The road then turns left and levels out at the same time; this is one of the many jumps of the N\u00fcrburgring where the car goes airborne.","This leads to the Adenauer Forst (forest) turns.","The Fuchsr\u00f6hre is one of the fastest and most dangerous parts of the N\u00fcrburgring because of the extremely high speeds in such a tight and confined place; this part of the N\u00fcrburgring goes right through a forest and there is only about 7\u20138 feet of grass separating the track from Armco barrier, and beyond the barriers is a wall of trees.","Perhaps the most notorious corner on the long circuit, Bergwerk has been responsible for some serious and sometimes fatal accidents.","A tight right-hand corner, coming just after a long, fast section and a left-hand kink on a small crest, was where Carel Godin de Beaufort fatally crashed.","The fast kink was also the scene of Niki Lauda's infamous fiery accident during the 1976 German Grand Prix.","This left kink is often referred to as the Lauda-Links (Lauda left).","The Bergwerk, along with the Breidscheid\/Adenauer Bridge corners before it, are one of the series of corners that make or break one's lap time around the N\u00fcrburgring because of the fast, lengthy uphill section called Kesselchen (Little Valley) that comes after the Bergwerk.","Although being one of the slower corners on the Nordschleife, the Karussell is perhaps its most famous and one of its most iconic- it is one of two berm-style, banked corners on the track.","Soon after the driver has negotiated the long uphill section after Bergwerk and gone through a section called Klostertal (Monastery Valley), the driver turns right through a long hairpin, past an abandoned section called Steilstrecke (Steep Route) and then goes up another hill towards the Karrusell.","The entrance to the corner is blind, although Juan Manuel Fangio is reputed to have advised a young driver to \"aim for the tallest tree,\" a feature that was also built into the rendering of the circuit in the Gran Turismo 4 and Grand Prix Legends video games.","Once the driver has reached the top of the hill, the road then becomes sharply banked on one side and level on the other- this banking drops off, rather than climbing up like most bankings on circuits.","The sharply banked side has a concrete surface, and there is a foot-wide tarmac surface on the bottom of the banking for cars to get extra grip through the very rough concrete banking.","Cars drop into the concrete banking, and keep the car in the corner (which is 210 degrees, much like a hairpin bend) until the road levels out and the concrete surface becomes tarmac again.","This corner is very hard on the driver's wrists and hands because of the prolonged bumpy cornering the driver must do while in the Karrusell.","Usually, cars come out of the top of the end of the banking to hit the apex that comes right after the end of the Karrusell.","The combination of a recognisable corner, slow-moving cars, and the variation in viewing angle as cars rotate around the banking, means that this is one of the circuit's most popular locations for photographers.","It is named after German pre-WWII racing driver Rudolf Caracciola, who reportedly made the corner his own by hooking the inside tires into a drainage ditch to help his car \"hug\" the curve.","As more concrete was uncovered and more competitors copied him, the trend took hold.","At a later reconstruction, the corner was remade with real concrete banking, as it remains to this day.","Shortly after the Karussell is a steep section, with gradients in excess of 16%, leading to a right-hander called Hohe Acht, which is some 300 m higher in altitude than Breidscheid.","A favourite spectator vantage point, the Br\u00fcnnchen section is composed of two right-hand corners and a very short straight.","The first corner goes sharply downhill and the next, after the very short downhill straight, goes uphill slightly.","This is a section of the track where on public days, accidents happen particularly at the blind uphill right-hand corner.","Like almost every corner at the N\u00fcrburgring, both right-handers are blind.","The short straight used to have a steep and sudden drop-off that caused cars to take off and a bridge that went over a pathway; these were taken out and smoothed over when the circuit was rebuilt in 1970 and 1971.","The Pflanzgarten, which is soon after the Br\u00fcnnchen, is one of the fastest, trickiest and most difficult sections of the N\u00fcrburgring.","It is full of jumps, including two huge ones, one of which is called Sprungh\u00fcgel (Jump Hill).","This very complex section is unique in that it is made up of two different sections; getting the entire Pflanzgarten right is crucial to a good lap time around the N\u00fcrburgring.","This section was the scene of Briton Peter Collins's fatal accident during the 1958 German Grand Prix, and the scene of a number of career-ending accidents in Formula One in the 1970s\u2014Britons Mike Hailwood and Ian Ashley were two victims of the Pflanzgarten.","Pflanzgarten 1 is made up of a slightly banked, downhill left-hander which then suddenly switches back left, then right.","Then immediately, giving the driver nearly no time to react (knowledge of this section is key) the road drops away twice: the first jump is only slight, then right after (somewhat like a staircase) the road drops away very sharply which usually causes almost all cars to go airborne at this jump; the drop is so sudden.","Then, immediately after the road levels out very shortly after the jump and the car touches the ground again, the road immediately and suddenly goes right very quickly and then right again; this is what makes up the end of the first Pflanzgarten- a very fast multiple apex sequence of right-hand corners.","The road then goes slightly uphill and then through another jump; the road suddenly drops away and levels out and at the same time, the road turns through a flat-out left-hander.","Then, the road drops away again very suddenly, which is the second huge jump of the Pflanzgarten known as the Sprungh\u00fcgel.","The road then goes downhill then quickly levels out, then it goes through a flat-out right-hander and this starts the Stefan Bellof S (named as such because Bellof crashed a Porsche 956 there during the 1983 Nurburgring 1000km), which was known as Pflanzgarten 2 prior to 2013.","The Stefan Bellof S is very tricky because the road quickly switches back left and right\u2014a car is going so fast through here that it is like walking on a tightrope.","It is very difficult to find the racing line here because the curves come up so quickly, so it is hard to find any point of reference.","Then, after a jump at the end of the switchback section, it goes through a flat-out, top gear right-hander and into a short straight that leads into two very fast curves called the Schwalbenschwanz (Swallow's Tail).","The room for error on every part of the consistently high-speed Pflanzgarten and the Stefan Bellof S is virtually non-existent (much like the entire track itself).","The road and the surface of the Pflanzgarten and the Stefan Bellof S moves around unpredictably; knowledge of this section is key to getting through cleanly.","The Schwalbenschwanz is a sequence of very fast sweepers located after the Stefan Bellof S. After a short straight, there is a very fast right-hand sweeper that progressively goes uphill, and this leads into a blind left-hander that is a bit slower.","The apex is completely blind, and the corner then changes gradient a bit; it goes up then down, which leads into a short straight that ends at the Kleines Karussell.","Originally, this part had a bridge that went over a stream and was very bumpy; this bridge was taken out and replaced with a culvert (large industrial pipe) so that the road could be smoothed over.","The Kleines Karussell is similar to its bigger brother, except that it is a 90-degree corner instead of 210 degrees, and is faster and slightly less banked.","Once this part of the track is dealt with, the drivers are near the end of the lap; with two more corners to negotiate before the 2.135km long D\u00f6ttinger H\u00f6he straight.","The N\u00fcrburgring S\u00fcdschleife (south loop) was a German motor racing circuit which was built in 1927 at the same time as the world-famous N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife (north loop).","The S\u00fcdschleife and Nordschleife layouts were joined together by the Start und Ziel (start\/finish) area, and could therefore be driven as one track that was over 28 kilometres (17mi) long.","Races were held at the combined layout only until 1931.","The S\u00fcdschleife was used for the ADAC Eifelrennen from 1928 until 1931 and from 1958 until 1968, as well as for the Eifelpokal and other minor races.","The S\u00fcdschleife was rarely used after the Nordschleife was rebuilt and updated in 1970 and 1971, and was finally destroyed by the building of the current N\u00fcrburgring Grand Prix circuit in the early 1980s.","Today only small sections of the original track remain.","The shared start\/finish area of the N\u00fcrburgring complex consisted of two back-to-back straights joined together at the southern end by a tight loop.","The entrance to the 7.5 kilometres (4.7mi) S\u00fcdschleife lay on the outside edge of this hairpin and was signposted as the road to Bonn.","It immediately dropped sharply downhill and under a public road before winding through a heavily-wooded section.","Tight corners soon gave way to fast downhill sections with flowing bends until, at the outskirts of the nearby town of M\u00fcllenbach, the track turned sharply right northwards and began a long climb up the hill.","At the end of this run came a right hairpin turn which led to a long left curve around the bottom of a hill.","This led onto the back straight of the start\/finish area.","At this point it was possible to continue onto the Nordschleife or take two sharp right-hand turns in order to enter the starting straight once again.","Photographs of the track in use show that trees and hedges were not cut back in many areas, being allowed to grow right up to the trackside.","Although the Nordschleife had very little in the way of run-off areas, the S\u00fcdschleife seems to have had none at all, which was likely to have been a factor in the choice of circuit for major events.","The route sections bore the following names, among others Br\u00e4nkekopf, Aschenschlag, Seifgen, Bocksberg, M\u00fcllenbach und Scharfer Kopf.","In 1938 a small section of new track (the Stichstra\u00dfe) was laid which allowed drivers nearing the end of the S\u00fcdschleife to bypass the start\/finish straights and take a right turn which led back to the start of the downhill twists.","This shortened a lap to around 5.7 kilometres (3.5mi).","This layout was used for tourist rides and for testing.","The current Grand Prix circuit required the complete destruction of the start\/finish area but at a point around 1km (0.62mi) into the S\u00fcdschleife, a modern public road now follows the route, although the bends have been eased and the vegetation does not come as close to the road as it did when the track was open.","This public road continues into the town of M\u00fcllenbach but leaves the route of the old track on the outskirts.","Nothing remains of the famous corners there.","The road up the hill still exists and is sometimes used to allow access to parking areas for the Grand Prix track.","The lower sections are no longer maintained.","Lap times recorded on the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife are published by several manufacturers.","They are published and discussed in print media, and online.","The lap record on the S\u00fcdschleife is held by Helmut Kelleners with 2:38.6 minutes = 175.85km\/h, driven with a March 707 in the CanAm run of the 3rd International AvD SCM circuit race on 18 October 1970.","Previous record holder was Brian Redman, who achieved 2:47.0 minutes = 161.03km\/h in the Formula 2 race on 21 April 1968 with a Ferrari.","The N\u00fcrburgring is known for its frequently changing weather.","The near-fatal accident of Niki Lauda in 1976 was accompanied by poor weather conditions and also the 2007 Grand Prix race saw an early deluge take several cars out through aquaplaning, with Vitantonio Liuzzi making a lucky escape, hitting a retrieving truck with the rear wing first, rather than the fatal accident that befell Jules Bianchi seven years later at Suzuka.","In spite of this reputation, the N\u00fcrburg weather station only recorded an average of 679.3 millimetres (26.74in) between 1981 and 2010.","Contrasting this, the relatively nearby Ardennes racetrack of Spa-Francorchamps in Wallonia, Belgium has a much rainier climate, seen by data from the village hosting the track called Stavelot and the village of Malmedy that circuit passes by.","N\u00fcrburg has a semi-continental climate with both oceanic and continental tendencies.","It does however land in the former category (K\u00f6ppen Cfb).","Due to the Nordschleife's varied terrain and elevation, weather may be completely different on either end of the track.","The elevation shift also makes thermal differences a strong possibility.","The modern Grand Prix circuit also has sizeable elevation changes between the start-finish straight and the lowest point on the opposite end of the track, but the geographical distance and actual elevation gain between the two are lower.","Annual sunshine is in the 1500s, which is low by European standards, but only slightly gloomier than the nearest large city of Cologne located on a plain.","Contrasting that, N\u00fcrburg has cooler weather year-round due to the higher elevation of the Eifel Mountains than the Rhine Valley."]},{"category":"Circuit","circuitId":21,"name":"Autodromo Enzo e Dino

Imola, is a 4.909km (3.050mi) motor racing circuit in the town of Imola, in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, 40 kilometres (25mi) east of Bologna.","It is one of the few major international circuits to run in an anti-clockwise direction.","The circuit is named after Ferrari's late founder, Enzo Ferrari, and his son, Alfredo \"Dino\" Ferrari, who died in 1956 at age 24.","Before Enzo's death, it was called Autodromo Dino Ferrari.","The circuit has an FIA Grade One licence.","Imola was the venue for the San Marino Grand Prix between 1981 and 2006.","During this period, two Grands Prix were held in Italy every year, with the Italian Grand Prix taking place at Monza, so the Imola race was named after the nearby state.","Imola also hosted the 1980 Italian Grand Prix in place of Monza.","When Formula One visits Imola, it is seen as the home circuit of Scuderia Ferrari, and masses of supporters come out to support the local team.","The venue returned to the Formula One calendar during the 2020 season to help the sport fill calendar gaps caused by cancellations of other races due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the race at the circuit being named the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in honour of the region where the circuit is located.","This also meant the venue hosted a World Championship race under a third different name having hosted the 1980 Italian Grand Prix and the San Marino Grand Prix from 1981 to 2006.","The track was inaugurated as a semi-permanent venue in 1953.","It had no chicanes, so the runs from Acque Minerali to Rivazza, and from Rivazza all the way to Tosa, through the pits and the Tamburello, were just straights with a few small bends; the circuit remained in this configuration until 1972.","In April 1953, the first motorcycle races took place, while the first car race took place in June 1954.","In April 1963, the circuit hosted its first Formula One race, as a non-championship event, won by Jim Clark for Lotus.","A further non-championship event took place at Imola in 1979, which was won by Niki Lauda for Brabham-Alfa Romeo.","In 1980 Imola officially debuted in the Formula One World Championship calendar by hosting the 1980 Italian Grand Prix.","It was the first time since the 1948 Edition held at Parco del Valentino that the Autodromo Nazionale Monza did not host the Italian Grand Prix.","The race was won by Nelson Piquet and it was such a success that a new race, the San Marino Grand Prix, was established especially for Imola in 1981 and remained on the calendar until 2006.","The race was held over 60 laps of the 5 kilometre circuit for a total race distance of 300 kilometres.","Imola has hosted a round of the Superbike World Championship from 2001 to 2006 and later since 2009.","It hosts the final round of the FIM Motocross World Championship since 2018.","The World Touring Car Championship visited Imola in 2005 for the Race of San Marino, in 2008 for the Race of Europe, and in 2009 for the Race of Italy.","The venue hosted a round of the International GT Open from 2009 to 2011.","The TCR International Series raced at Imola in 2016.","The 6 Hours of Imola was revived in 2011 and added to the Le Mans Series and Intercontinental Le Mans Cup as a season event until 2016.","Since 2017 it hosts the 12 Hours of Imola, a round of the 24H Series.","The track was also used as part of the finishing circuit for the 1968 UCI Road World Championships, which saw Italian cyclist Vittorio Adorni winning with a lead of 10 minutes and 10 seconds over runner up Herman Van Springel, the second largest winning margin in the history of the championships, after Georges Ronsse's victory in 1928.","In addition Adorni's countryman Michele Dancelli took the bronze and five of the top six finishers were Italian.","The circuit was used for stage 11 of the 2015 Giro d'Italia, which was won by Ilnur Zakarin, and stage 12 of the 2018 Giro d'Italia, won by Sam Bennett.","The circuit also served as the start and finish of the 2020 UCI Road World Championships on 27 September 2020.","Despite the addition of the chicanes to several parts of the lap, the circuit was subject to constant safety concerns, mostly regarding the flat-out Tamburello corner, which was very bumpy and had dangerously little room between the track and a concrete wall without a tyre barrier that separated the circuit from the Santerno river that runs adjacent to it.","In 1987, Nelson Piquet crashed heavily during practice after a tyre failure and missed the race due to injury.","In the 1989 San Marino Grand Prix, Gerhard Berger crashed his Ferrari at Tamburello after a front wing failure.","The car caught fire after the heavy impact but thanks to the quick work of the firefighters and medical personnel Berger survived and missed only one race (the 1989 Monaco Grand Prix) due to burns to his hands.","Michele Alboreto also had a fiery accident at the Tamburello corner testing his Footwork Arrows at the circuit in 1991 but escaped injury.","Riccardo Patrese also had an accident at the Tamburello corner in 1992 while testing for the Williams team.","The death of Ayrton Senna on 1 May 1994 sealed the fate of the corner being run flat out ever again.","To make Tamburello safer, it became a left\u2013right\u2013left chicane instead of a flat out left hander to slow down cars.","In the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, during Friday practice Rubens Barrichello was launched over a kerb and into the top of a tyre barrier at the Variante Bassa, knocking the Brazilian unconscious, though quick medical intervention saved his life.","During Saturday qualifying Austrian Roland Ratzenberger crashed head-on into a wall at over 310km\/h at the Villeneuve corner after his Simtek lost the front wing, dying instantly from a basilar skull fracture.","The tragedy continued the next day, when the three-time World Champion Ayrton Senna lost control of his car and crashed into the concrete wall at the Tamburello corner on Lap 7.","Senna died in hospital several hours after his crash.","In two unrelated incidents, several spectators and mechanics were also injured during the event.","In the aftermath, the circuit continued to host Grands Prix, but revisions were immediately made in an attempt to make it safer.","The flat-out Tamburello corner was reduced to a 4th gear left\u2013right sweeper, and a gravel trap was added to the limited space on the outside of the corner.","Villeneuve corner, previously an innocuous 6th gear right-hander into Tosa, was made a complementary 4th gear sweeper, also with a gravel trap on the outside of the corner.","In an attempt to retain some of the quickness and character of the old circuit, the arduous chicane at Acqua Minerali was eliminated, and the Variante Bassa was straightened into a single chicane.","Many say that the new circuit configuration is not as good as it used to be as a result of the new chicanes at Tamburello and Villeneuve.","Another modification made to the Imola track is that of Variante Alta, which is situated at the top of the hill leading down to Rivazza and has the hardest braking point on the lap.","The Variante Alta, formerly a high-kerbed chicane, was hit quite hard by the drivers which caused damage to the cars and occasionally was the site of quite a few accidents.","Before the 2006 Grand Prix, the kerbs were lowered considerably and the turn itself was tightened to reduce speeds and hopefully reduce the number of accidents at the chicane.","The Grand Prix was removed from the calendar of the 2007 Formula One season.","SAGIS, the company that owns the circuit, hoped that the race would be reinstated at the October 2006 meeting of the FIA World Motor Sport Council and scheduled for the weekend of 29 April 2007, provided renovations to the circuit were completed in time for the race, but the reinstatement was denied.","Since 2007, the circuit has undergone major revisions.","A bypass to the Variante Bassa chicane was added for cars, making the run from Rivazza 2 to the first Tamburello chicane totally flat-out, much like the circuit in its original fast-flowing days.","However, the chicane is still used for motorcycle races.","The old pit garages and paddock have been demolished and completely rebuilt while the pitlane was extended and resurfaced.","The reconstruction was overseen by German F1 track architect Hermann Tilke.","In June 2008, with most of the reconstruction work completed, The FIA gave the track a \"1T\" rating, meaning that an official Formula One Test can be held at the circuit; circuits require the \"1\" homologation to host a Formula One Grand Prix.","As of August 2011, the track received a '1' FIA homologation rating after an inspection by Charlie Whiting.","In June 2015, the owners of the circuit confirmed they were in talks to return to the Formula One calendar should Monza, whose contract was scheduled to run out after the 2016 season, be unable to make a new deal to keep hosting a round of the world championship.","On 18 July 2016, Imola signed a deal to host the Italian Grand Prix from the 2017 season.","However, on 2 September 2016, it was announced that Monza had secured a new deal to continue in hosting the race, and Imola's officials took legal action against this decision questioning the legality of government funding awarded to Monza.","On 8 November 2016, they withdrew their case.","In February 2020, the owners at Imola submitted a bid to replace the 2020 Chinese Grand Prix pending its cancellation as a precaution in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.","On 24 July 2020, it was confirmed that the circuit would be added to the calendar for the 2020 Formula One World Championship with the race being called the \"Emilia Romagna Grand Prix\" in honour of the region the circuit is situated in.","In a break with Formula One tradition the event at the circuit took place over two days instead of three on 31 October and 1 November 2020.","Imola was kept on the calendar for 2021, following the postponement of the Chinese Grand Prix due to the ongoing pandemic, and later for the 2022 calendar as well.","The circuit's president is Giancarlo Minardi of the former Minardi F1 team.","Since 1981, the circuit has been hosting the early-September Mostra Scambio (\"Trading Exposition\"), an open-air market primarily focused on the exhibition and trade of vintage vehicles and their parts; this event is also popularly (but inaccurately) called CRAME, after the name of the historical society organizing it.The 2020 edition was cancelled due to the COVID-19.","Partially due to the vicinity of the Romeo Galli athletics stadium, the Acque Minerali park, and the Tre Monti hills, the Autodromo is not commonly used for bicycle or on-foot sporting activities (albeit with notable exceptions, such as two segments of the Giro d'Italia in the 2010s, and 2020 UCI Road World Championships); however, the civic

added, exposed vegetation was barricaded off and straw bales were removed (but still used for the Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix).","In 2002, the chicane was slightly modified, 130R (marked as 15 on the diagram) was also modified and some of the snake curves were made a bit straighter and faster; additionally, the runoff area at the Dunlop Curve was doubled from 12 metres to 25 metres, and the corner itself was made slightly tighter.","In 2003, the chicane was made slightly faster and closer to the 130R.","Following the death of Daijiro Kato at the 2003 Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix, Suzuka reconfigured the motorcycle variant of what is now known as the Hitachi Automotive Systems Chicane before the final turn, and added a second chicane, between the hairpin and 200R.","The circuit can be used in five configurations; the car full circuit, the motorcycle full circuit, the \"Suzuka east,\" \"Suzuka west car,\" and \"Suzuka west motorcycle\" configurations.","The \"east\" portion of the course consists of the pit straight to the first half of the Dunlop curve (turn seven), before leading back to the pit straight via a tight right-hander.","The \"west\" course is made up of the other part of the full circuit, including the crossover bridge; the straight leading to the overpass is used for the start\/finish line and the grid.","The chicane between the hairpin and 200R separates the west and full course sections between cars and motorcycles.","The Degner curve was named in honour of Ernst Degner after he crashed his factory Suzuki 50 there during Suzuka's inaugural All Japan Championship Road Race meeting on 3 November 1962.","The hairpin (turn 11) was coined 'Kobayashi Corner' after Japanese driver Kamui Kobayashi passed five drivers with aggressive moves at the 2010 Japanese Grand Prix.","In 2014 Jules Bianchi suffered a fatal crash after colliding with a recovery vehicle.","Suzuka, openly touted by F1 drivers and fans as one of the most enjoyed, is also one of the oldest remaining tracks of the Formula One World Championship, and has a long history of races as venue of the Japanese Grand Prix since 1987.","Its traditional role as one of the last Grands Prix of the season means numerous world championships have been decided at the track.","Four years consecutively in its early history the circuit saw the world championship decided.","These include the 1988 championship, which went to Ayrton Senna, the controversial 1989 championship, which went to Alain Prost, and the 1990 and 1991 world championships, which both went to Senna.","Suzuka was dropped from the Formula One calendar for the 2007 and 2008 seasons in favour of the Toyota-owned Fuji Speedway, after the latter underwent a transformation and redesign by circuit designer Hermann Tilke.","Suzuka and Fuji were to alternate hosting the Japanese Grand Prix from 2009.","However, after Fuji announced in July 2009 that it would no longer be part of the F1 calendar, Suzuka signed a deal to host the Japanese Grand Prix in 2009, 2010 and 2011.","The circuit closed for a year for renovations to make it F1-compliant for 2009, with the last major event held on November 18, 2007, although some annual events (for instance, the Suzuka 8 Hours and Suzuka 1000km) were still held.","The track held a re-opening day on April 12, 2009.","Suzuka also hosts other motorsport events including the Suzuka 1000km endurance race.","Previously a part of multiple GT racing series including the now defunct group C class of the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship, the Suzuka 1000km as of 2006 is now a points round of the Super GT Series, and is the only race of such length in that series.","In 2010, the GT500 pole position time was 1:55.237.","In 2007, the GT300 pole position time was 2:06.838.","Another major motorsport event is the Suzuka 8 Hours for motorcycles, which has been run since 1978.","This event usually attracts big name riders and with the exception of 2005, due to the importance of the major manufacturers' involvement, the FIM ensures that no motorcycle races clash on the date.","NASCAR organized the NASCAR Thunder 100, a pair of exhibition 100-lap races on the east circuit, a 1.4 miles (2.3km) layout which utilizes the pit straight and esses, before rejoining the main circuit near the Casio triangle.","The cars were Sprint Cup Series and Camping World West Series cars and the field was by invitation for the two races, run after the 1996 and 1997 seasons.","The 1996 event was marred by tragedy when during practice, pace car driver Elmo Langley died of a heart attack in the Chevrolet Corvette pace car at the esses during an evaluation run.","The pole position speed was 83.079 miles per hour (133.703km\/h).","During qualifying for the 1997 race, rain caused Goodyear to use rain tires on Winston Cup cars for the first time in the modern era.","It was announced on June 21, 2010 that the east section of the Suzuka Circuit would host the Japan round of the 2011 WTCC season instead of the Okayama International Circuit.","At the 2012 event, the pole position time was 52.885 seconds, for an average speed of 94.875 miles per hour (152.687km\/h).","Following two major accidents in 2002 and 2003, one of the main issues in safety has been at the corner 130R (marked 15 in the track map above).","In 2002, Toyota F1 driver Allan McNish suffered a high-speed crash through the bump, which sent him through a metal fence; he was not seriously injured.","Track officials revised the 130R, redesigning it as a double-apex section, one with an 85 metres (279ft) radius, and then a second featuring a 340 metres (1,115ft) radius, leading to a much closer Casio triangle (chicane), with the chicane becoming a \"bus stop\" type for motorcycles.","However, the problem continued for the new revised section.","During the 2003 MotoGP Grand Prix of Japan, the track's first major event since the revisions, MotoGP rider Daijiro Kato was killed when he crashed in the new section, on his way to the braking zone for the Casio triangle.","MotoGP has not returned to Suzuka since the incident.","The official lap record for the current circuit layout is 1:30.983, set by Lewis Hamilton during the 2019 Japanese Grand Prix.","Previously, the record was set in 2005 by Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen with a time of 1:31.540.","The unofficial all-time track record is 1:27.064, set by Sebastian Vettel during final qualifying for the aforementioned 2019 race.","Along with Fuji Speedway, the Suzuka Circuit was one of the four tracks featured in the video game Pole Position II.","The track is referred to in the Namco Museum versions of the game as the \"Wonder Circuit\" (\"Orange Circuit\" in Namco Museum: Virtual Arcade), after Namco's \"Wonder\" series of amusement parks, despite its logo appearing on the starter's box since 1983.","The Suzuka Circuit is also featured in the Final Lap series of games which first appeared in 1987.","Another Namco racing game, Suzuka 8 Hours, based on the motorcycle race of the same name was released for arcades in 1992, followed by a port for the Super NES in 1993.","It can also be seen in arcade games and video games such as Ferrari F355 Challenge, Super Monaco GP, Forza Motorsport 2, Forza Motorsport 3, Forza Motorsport 4, Forza Motorsport 7, Gran Turismo 4, Gran Turismo 5

featured in NASCAR 98.","Suzuka's Ferris wheel was paid homage in the \"Big Forest Track\" in Virtua Racing.","A mod for Mario Kart Wii, CTGP Revolution, exists that adds the track.","Project CARS and Project CARS 2 have a Japanese circuit inspired by Suzuka, called Sakitto Circuit.","Sakitto has numerous visual differences from the original Suzuka, including the change of position of the Ferris

motorsport race track in Spielberg, Styria, Austria.","The race circuit was founded as \u00d6sterreichring (translation: Austrian Circuit) and hosted the Austrian Grand Prix for 18 consecutive years, from 1970 to 1987.","It was later shortened, rebuilt and renamed the A1-Ring (A Eins-Ring), and it hosted the Austrian Grand Prix again from 1997 to 2003.","When Formula One outgrew the circuit, a plan was drawn up to extend the layout.","Parts of the circuit, including the pits and main grandstand, were demolished, but construction work was stopped and the circuit remained unusable for several years before it was purchased by Red Bull's Dietrich Mateschitz and rebuilt.","Renamed the Red Bull Ring the track was reopened on 15 May 2011 and subsequently hosted a round of the 2011 DTM season and a round of the 2011 F2 championship.","Formula One returned to the circuit in the 2014 season, and MotoGP returned to the circuit in the 2016 season.","The Red Bull Ring also hosted a second F1 event named the Styrian Grand Prix in 2020 and 2021; and a second MotoGP event named the Styrian motorcycle Grand Prix in 2020 and 2021 after the COVID-19 Pandemic affected the schedules of both of those seasons.","Originally built in 1969 to replace the bland and bumpy Zeltweg Airfield circuit located just across the street, the \u00d6sterreichring track was situated in the Styrian mountains and it was a visually spectacular and scenic circuit.","Although narrow at 10 metres (33ft) in all places, the track was very fast, every corner was a fast sweeper and was taken in no lower than third gear in a five-speed gearbox and fourth in a six-speed gearbox.","It had noticeable changes in elevation during the course of a lap, 65 metres from lowest to highest point.","Like most fast circuits it was a hard circuit on engines but more difficult on tires, because of the speeds being so consistently high.","Many considered the \u00d6sterreichring to be dangerous, especially the Bosch Kurve, a 180-degree banked downhill right-hand corner with almost no run-off area which, by 1986 when turbos pushed Formula One engine power to upwards of 1,400bhp (1,044kW; 1,419PS) in qualifying, saw Derek Warwick speed trapped at 344km\/h (214mph) in his BMW powered Brabham BT55 on the run to the Bosch Kurve.","There were other testing corners such as Voest-Hugel, which was a flat-out 290 kilometres per hour (180mph) right-hander that eventually led to the 240 kilometres per hour (150mph) Sebring-Auspuff Kurve (this corner had many names over the years, Dr. Tiroch and Glatz Kurve were others) which was an essential corner to get right because of the long straight afterwards that led to the Bosch Kurve.","Some of the track was just road with little to no protection at all, even up to the final Austrian Grand Prix there in 1987, a race that had to be restarted twice because of two progressively more serious accidents both caused by the narrow pit straight in a similar manner to the 1985 race when the race was stopped after one lap following a start line shunt that had taken out three cars including championship leader Michele Alboreto's Ferrari and local driver Gerhard Berger's Arrows-BMW.","In practice for the 1987 race McLaren's Stefan Johansson narrowly avoided serious injury or worse when at over 240 kilometres per hour (150mph) he collided with a deer that had made its way onto the track while Johansson was cresting a blind brow before the Jochen Rindt Kurve behind the pits.","Increasing speeds were also a concern at the \u00d6sterreichring; during the final Grand Prix there in 1987 pole-sitter Nelson Piquet's time for the 5.942km (3.692mi) of 1:23.357 set an average speed record for the circuit of 256.621 kilometres per hour (159.457mph).","At the time it was second only in F1 average speed to Keke Rosberg's 258.9 kilometres per hour (160.9mph) pole lap of the Silverstone Circuit set during the 1985 British Grand Prix.","Both times were set using a turbocharged Williams-Honda.","American driver Mark Donohue died after crashing at the Vost-Hugel Kurve in 1975.","In 1976, the Vost-Hugel Kurve was tightened and made into one right hander rather than two right-handers with a small section between, and in 1977 it was slowed down and became the Hella-Licht chicane, going from the fastest to the slowest corner on the track.","It is also known that four-time World Champion Alain Prost often said that all tracks can be changed but that the \u00d6sterreichring should remain unchanged, just adding run-off areas would be fine, which eventually did happen up until the original track's final year in 1995.","The track was known for having many crashes at the start of races (especially 1.8 metres (6ft) Formula One cars at the Austrian Grand Prix) because the start\u2013finish straight was very narrow (about 9.1 metres (30ft) wide), while most start\u2013finish straights on other tracks were 18 to 24 metres (60 to 80ft)  and it did not provide enough space for cars attempting to pass others, especially cars that stalled or broke at the start.","Motorcycle rider Hans-Peter Klampfer died after a collision with another rider at the Bosch Kurve (where most fatalities happened) and 29-year-old Hannes Wustinger was also killed after a crash at the Tiroch Kurve (the part that was left out of the present circuit) at a race for the Austrian Touring car championship and this sealed the decision to build a new circuit.","Triple World Champion and long time hero of the home crowd Niki Lauda is the only Austrian driver to win his home Grand Prix.","He won the 1984 Austrian Grand Prix at the \u00d6sterreichring driving a McLaren-TAG Porsche.","Lauda went on to win his third and final championship in 1984, beating his teammate Alain Prost by the smallest margin in F1 history, only half a point.","He announced his permanent retirement from driving at the circuit before the 1985 race.","The \u00d6sterreichring's safety concerns had reached a head in the mid 1990s, and in 1995 and 1996 it was totally rebuilt, at the same site, by Hermann Tilke.","Its length was shortened from 5.942km (3.692mi) to 4.326km (2.688mi), and the fast sweeping corners were replaced by three tight right-handers, in order to create overtaking opportunities.","Its three long straights, as well as a twisty infield section, asked for a setup compromise.","As much of the construction work was paid for by the mobile phone provider A1, the track was renamed the A1-Ring.","It proceeded to host seven Formula One Austrian Grands Prix between 1997 and 2003, as well as several DTM races and the Austrian motorcycle Grand Prix in 1996 and 1997.","The grandstands and pit buildings were demolished in 2004, rendering the track unusable for any motorsport category.","In late 2004 and early 2005, there were intense discussions concerning whether the owner of the circuit, Red Bull, would find another use for the site, or return motor sports to the venue.","There was a circuit extension proposal using part of the old \u00d6sterreichring.","In January 2005, return of motor sports seemed more unlikely than ever, as Dietrich Mateschitz publicly announced that he had no intention of wasting money on a deficient circuit.","Throughout 2005 however, there was speculation of the newly founded Red Bull Racing renovating the track to use it as a test venue.","In 2006, Austrian racing driver Alexander Wurz claimed he would buy the circuit and have it renovated, but the idea never came to fruition.","By 2007, talks involving Red Bull, KTM, Volkswagen and Magna International for a neuer \u00d6sterreichring failed, after VW pulled out.","Late in 2008, Red Bull began their \u20ac70m reconstruction of the track and DTM chiefs considered a return to the circuit in 2009, and in September 2010, it was confirmed that the circuit, now known as the Red Bull Ring, would host a round of the 2011 DTM season.","The championship has visited the circuit every year since then until 2018.","In November 2010, F2 announced that Round 6 of the 2011 F2 championship would take place at the Red Bull Ring.","The circuit was reopened at a special event over the weekend of 15\u201316 May 2011, which included displays of various Red Bull sponsored teams including Red Bull Racing.","The FIA Historic Formula One Championship was invited to provide the headline race attraction with a race on each day for Formula One cars from the 3-litre period.","In December 2012, Red Bull contacted the FIA to say the track would be available to host a round of the Formula One World Championship in 2013, after a slot became available following the postponement of the proposed New York metropolitan area Grand Prix of America, and by July 2013, Red Bull announced that the Austrian Grand Prix would return as a round of the Formula One World Championship in 2014.","The Austrian Grand Prix was held on 22 June 2014.","From 2014 until 2016, the track also hosted a round of the Red Bull Air Race World Championship.","On 11 February 2016, it was announced that MotoGP would return to the circuit in 2016 for the first time since 1997.","On 30 June 2019, in honour of the late 3-time Formula One World Champion Niki Lauda, the first turn of the track was  renamed the \"Niki Lauda Curve\".","On 30 May 2020, it was reported  that the Austrian government had given permission for two Formula One races to be held on 5 and 12 July 2020 respectively to kick off the 2020 Formula One season after its start had been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.","On 2 June 2020, Formula One confirmed the Red Bull Ring would hold back to back races on 5 and 12 July to start the 2020 season, with the second race styled as a one-off Styrian Grand Prix.","It would also hold the first four races of the 2020 FIA Formula 2 Championship and the 2020 FIA Formula 3 Championship.","This made it the first European circuit to host the opening round of a Formula One season  since the Circuit de Monaco did this in the 1966 season as well as the first time Austria hosted the opening race of the World Championship and therefore the first time the circuit hosted the opening round - an honour given to 13 previous venues since the inception of the World Championship in 1950.","The circuit also hosted back to back races of the 2020 MotoGP season on 16 and 23 August, with the second race styled as a one off Styrian Grand Prix.","In the 2021 Formula One season, the Red Bull Ring hosted two races again due to the Canadian Grand Prix being cancelled and the Turkish Grand Prix being postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.","The first of the two was titled as the Styrian Grand Prix, with the second being called the Austrian Grand Prix.","These two races a week apart from each other saw Max Verstappen winning both from pole position.","Also in MotoGP, following the cancellation of the Finnish Grand Prix in May 2021, the Styrian Grand Prix was added to the calendar on the weekend of 6 to 8 August, one week before the Austrian Grand Prix.","The first race saw MotoGP rookie Jorge Mart\u00edn claim his and Pramac

and is the only event added to the Supercars Hall of Fame.","During Adelaide's era hosting the Australian Grand Prix, the circuit also hosted annual non-championship races for the Australian Touring Car Championship, the previous incarnation of Supercars.","Between 2014 and 2018, an annual Adelaide Motorsport Festival ran on the Victoria Park Sprint Circuit, a shortened 1.4km (0.87mi) layout.","The layout turned right along Wakefield Street after the Senna Chicane and then rejoined the main circuit for the final corners.","The event had attracted older Formula 1 machinery, with Ivan Capelli holding the lap record in a March CG891.","The 500-metre-long pit straight is inside the Victoria Park.","During the Formula One and early V8 Supercar eras the Victoria Park Racecourse, a horse racing track, was located at the park, though has since been removed.","The buildings and grandstands are temporary and removed each year due to ongoing campaigning by the Adelaide Parklands Preservation Association Inc.\nAt the end of the straight, drivers negotiate the Senna Chicane, so named after triple World Champion Ayrton Senna following his death at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.","Senna had sat on the pole for the first Adelaide Grand Prix in 1985, and would go on to take the pole in Adelaide 6 times in 9 races, while winning in 1991 (the shortest race in Formula One history due to torrential rain), as well as his last career victory in 1993.","After the chicane the cars take a fast left turn to go uphill on a short straight on Wakefield Road to East

the track follows the fast turn 8 sweeper.","This corner was re-configured in 2009 and it produced some protests from many of the teams due to its speed and lack of runoff area.","Turn 8 has been the site of many crashes in the various categories that have used the shortened version of the circuit.","The full Grand Prix circuit bypasses the turn onto Bartels Road and continues with a sweeping left-right-right into Stag Turn (turn 9).","This leads onto the 360-metre-long Jones Straight, known as Rundle Road for the rest of the year and named after Australia's 1980 World Champion Alan

1,014PS) Formula One cars in the turbo era (1985\u201388) were reaching speeds in excess of 200mph (322km\/h) making Adelaide easily the fastest street circuit of the time as the only others were the much tighter Monaco, Detroit and Phoenix circuits.","The short form of the track rejoins Brabham Straight \u2154 of the way down, so the 640-metre-long Bartels Road straight is longest on that layout.","In 2007 this section of track was renamed Brock Straight after touring car driver Peter Brock.","At the end of Brabham Straight is a right hand hairpin turn (at the Britannia Roundabout) onto Wakefield Road, then a left turn and long sweeping right hand curve back into Victoria Park behind the pit area.","The lap concludes with another right-hand hairpin (Racetrack Hairpin) onto the

slight incline.","All of these sections of track run in an east\u2013west direction.","The elevation ranges from 36 to 53 metres.","When the idea of holding a Grand Prix in the parklands was first raised, there was some opposition from people concerned about environmental damage, as the parks have a number of mature trees with birds and possums living in them.","There is no larger wildlife in the parklands, as they are heavily developed.","These concerns seem to have been proven unfounded, as spectators often watch magpies and rosellas when there is nothing happening on the track.","Indeed, the total road traffic during race weekend is significantly less than there is any other day of the year.","The race meetings have the feature race, but also a number of races for \"lesser\" categories, making four days of entertainment for the crowds of spectators, without long periods of boredom that could occur if only practice and qualifying for the main event preceded it.","Many of the events also have after-race concerts on a stage erected for the purpose on a playing field in the middle of the track.","Some of the artists who have performed the concerts either at the Grand Prix or the Clipsal 500 include Cher, Paul Simon, Tina Turner, Daryl Braithwaite, INXS and Kiss.","During her concert following the 1993 AGP, Tina Turner had an impromptu visitor in the form of the race winner and triple World Champion Ayrton Senna.","Although she had already performed the song earlier, as a tribute to Senna, Turner again sung her hit song \"The Best\".","The stadium

part of the old fast circuit, modified to a lesser degree were Sunset Bend, Clubhouse Bend and the Esses still incorporated into the current configuration, with the result that the circuit became a narrow, twisty ribbon rather than one of the fastest circuits on the calendar.","Formula One abandoned the rebuilt circuit in 1993 after just two races on the new layout, caused by a bankruptcy on the part of the promoter.","It hosted the South African motorcycle Grand Prix until 1992.","Kyalami was changed again with the building of the current pit lane and start\/finish straight and later again changes were made, with the addition of a chicane which in turn was removed again for the 2009 World Superbike race.","Kyalami came under new management and 2008 saw the 50th Anniversary of the 9-Hour

the throttle and dipping on the brakes through the quick right-hander known as Sunset, one of only four corners left as they were in the first layout.","A short burst of throttle is followed by braking at the 50-metre board for turn 7, Clubhouse, a slow left-hander typically taken in second gear.","Once again utilising the exit kerb, the driver barrels down a short straight before braking, again at the 50-metre board, for turn 8.","Turns 8 and 9, known as The Esses, are the final corners left over from the first layout.","8 is a medium-speed left hander typically taken in third gear, dipping the driver downhill before the car is flicked right into turn 9.","Acceleration is key as the driver rejoins the new layout, going uphill before having to brake roughly 50 metres for the blind tenth corner, known as Leeukop.","The driver typically decelerates and shifts down the gears to second or first gear, meeting the apex of the corner before accelerating through turn 11.","The back straight lasts for a few hundred metres before the driver approaches turn 12, a flat-out left hander known as Mineshaft.","Spotting a braking point for turn 13, the first corner of The Crocodiles, can be hard, as it is an off-camber right handed turn which can be taken with several different lines.","Turn 14 is little more than the full throttle exit of turn 13, and sets the driver up for turn 15.","Cheetah is a tight right hander which the driver typically only needs to lift off the throttle for.","It's important to carry speed through it, before spotting a braking point for the final corner.","Ingwe is a slow left-hander which sends the driver back onto the start-finish straight to complete the lap.","From 1967 to 1993, Kyalami hosted 21 editions of the South African Grand

death of his father in 2009.","Wheatcroft vowed to re-open Donington Park as soon as possible.There were hopes to re-open the circuit in August 2010, and this was accomplished with the Donington Revival meeting.","On 26 May 2010 Wheatcroft announced that the lease for Donington Park had been sold (Subject To Contract) to Worcestershire-based Adroit Group.","Adroit proceeded to resurrect the circuit, not only rebuilding the removed track sections, but also renewing infrastructure.","This included the re-alignment of Foggy's bend, but not the old Dunlop Bridge due to new built MSA\/FIA regulations.","As a result of a series of inspections, the circuit successfully regained its ACU, MSA and FIA Grade 2 licences.","However, Wheatcrofts and Adroit failed to agree terms of a final lease contract, and hence terminated their outline agreement.","The Wheatcroft-owned company Donington Park Racing took control of the circuit in late 2010, gaining events from both World Touring Cars and the World Superbikes, plus the inaugural Donington Historic Festival.","60 race days are held each year, including events from the British Touring Car Championship, British Superbikes, World Superbikes, British GT, rallying and historic festivals for both cars and motorcycles.","Racing takes place on most weekends between March and October, with visits from most British racing clubs.","Donington has also been host to the annual Season Launch for the BTCC since 2013, while the British Superbike Championship also holds major test days at the circuit.","The FIA Formula E Championship and its teams also constructed its headquarters at the circuit in the early years of its competition.","All teams in the electric series were based at the venue, and Donington hosted several pre-season test dates before each season, some of which were open to spectators.","For the 2017\u201318 season, the series switched their pre-season test venue to the Circuit Ricardo Tormo in Valencia, Spain.","Wheatcroft has also invested heavily to restore the circuit infrastructure to its former glories.","The infield which was excavated during the late 2000s has been completely restored and raised even higher in some areas, while pit and paddock facilities have also been improved.","Outside the circuit boundaries, an all terrain course has been constructed, as well as improvements to hospitality buildings and conferencing suites.","In January 2017, the circuit business was taken over by MotorSport Vision, with the Donington Park Estate on a 21-year lease, until 2038.","The purchase was cleared by the Competition and Markets Authority in August 2017, with work commencing almost immediately on venue improvements.","Additions over the winter period of 2017-18 included a full resurface of paddock areas and access roads, the addition of the Garage 39 Restaurant, cafe and bar, and a large new grandstand at Hollywood corner.","Several old toilet blocks were also demolished to make way for more modern units.","while detail changes were carried out around the venue.","For 2019, work was completed on a new main entrance area near the existing paddock entrance, that better separates pedestrians from vehicle traffic.","In April 2021 MSV announced it had purchased the freehold of the Donington Hall Estate comprising Donington Hall itself, former office building Hastings House and the Lansdowne workshops building.","The estate is set in 28 acres of grounds next to the Donington Park race circuit.","MSV plans to develop the Grade II* listed Hall into a 40-bedroom hotel, scheduled to open in 2023.","Hastings House will become the Donington Hall Motorhouse, a stabling facility for supercars, classic road and racing cars and motorcycles, whilst the Lansdowne workshops, will be available to let for high-end motor engineering businesses which support the preparation and maintenance of vehicles kept at the Donington Hall Motorhouse and used on the race circuit.","Donington Park has long been home to many prestigious motorsport events including BTCC, British F3, British Superbike Championship, WorldSBK, Superleague Formula, Truck Racing.","Donington Park was the host of the 1993 European Grand Prix on 11 April 1993, which was affected by rain.","The race was notable for the dominance of Ayrton Senna where he won the race by over 1 minute from Damon Hill, having advanced from fifth to first in the opening lap.","This race was described by AtlasF1 as the 'Drive of the Decade'.","There is a memorial to Senna in the grounds of the racetrack, outside the Donington Collections.","On 4 July 2008, Bernie Ecclestone announced that Donington Park would hold the British Grand Prix from 2010 onwards in a 17-year deal, having been hosted exclusively by Silverstone since 1987.","On 10 July 2008, the proposal was that the track would have a major upgrade designed by Hermann Tilke, to include an entirely new pit complex along Starkey's Straight and increasing the circuit length to 2.944 miles (4.738km), by the addition of a new infield loop, to get it up to the standards required for modern day Formula One racing.","The proposal was that race would be the first to be accessed only by public transportation, as cars will not be allowed to enter the facility.","This was in part was an answer to the lack of road access, which even when 30,000 bikers exit major motorcycle events resulted in long tailbacks.","The proposal was that a shuttle-bus service would run from the close by East Midlands Parkway station, on the Midland Main Line from London to Sheffield.","In light of the financial crisis and Donington's potential inability to raise finance, on 20 June 2009, Bernie Ecclestone stated that there would be a British Grand Prix at Silverstone in 2010 if Donington was not ready to host it.","This was a change from his previous \"Donington or nothing\" standpoint and he cited changes in the structure of the BRDC meaning there was a better way of negotiating with them over future commercial rights.","Furthermore, during an interview with the BBC about the Formula One Teams Association threatening to break away and form their own series, FIA president Max Mosley said it was \"highly likely\" the 2010 British Grand Prix would return to Silverstone.","Donington was given an extended two-week deadline to prove it had the funds to host the 2010 British Grand Prix, however, on 22 October 2009, fundraising attempts fell through.","Ecclestone later confirmed that Donington would not be hosting the British Grand Prix.","On 18 November 2009, less than one month after it was confirmed that the Donington had lost the right to host the British Grand Prix, circuit owner Donington Ventures Leisure Limited was placed into administration.","Although Ecclestone gave the option of reviving the deal for new owners, in December 2009 Silverstone won the contract for the next 17 years.","Donington Park has also been the home of MotoGP.","After the Isle of Man TT Races lost World Championship status, from the 1977 UK inaugural race, MotoGP was held at Silverstone until 1986.","For the next 23 years, Donington held the race up until 2009, but in light of the proposed Donington Formula 1 deal, MotoGP organisers Dorna Sports agreed a five-year deal with Silverstone from 2010.","Following the failed 2010 Formula 1 bid, in less than a year Donington had lost both competitions for the foreseeable future.","Donington Park was proposed to host the MotoGP British Grand Prix as an alternative venue chosen for 2015, since the Circuit of Wales, having won the Dorna contract from 2015, will be unfinished.","However, in February 2015, it was announced that Donington had called off the deal, and that 2015 MotoGP would likely remain at Silverstone.","Donington Park has been a mainstay of the BTCC calendar, since the series was created in 1987 (as a development from the previous British Saloon Car Championship).","In 1999 Donington was the location of one of the standout events from the BTCC's Super Touring era.","Matt Neal caused a sensation by winning a race in his Nissan Primera, the first 'Independent' to do so in the modern era.","This won him a \u00a3250,000 prize from BTCC series promoter Alan Gow.","After five years at Brands Hatch, the WTCC moved to Donington Park in 2011.","The event attracted thousands of people on race day, where the two races were both won by Yvan Muller for Chevrolet.","The weekend also had two races for the Auto GP series as well as the Maserati Trofeo.","The 2012 WTCC season did not include a UK-based round of the competition.","Donington hosted rounds of the German DTM (Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters) series in 2002 & 2003.","Former F1 driver Jean Alesi secured a clean sweep of wins across both years for AMG Mercedes.","The Park hosted a stage of the 1989 RAC Rally.Donington is the venue for two rallies, with one of the events being a round of the MSN Circuit Rally Championship.","These events do not take place exclusively on the circuit, including sections on the looser sections surrounding the track itself.","Donington was one of the venues for the 2001 European Le Mans Series season.","It was a series for Le Mans Prototypes (LMP) and Grand Touring (GT) race cars run by IMSA.","The ill-fated series began in March 2001 and ended in October that year after only 7 races.","The Donington winner was Audi Sport Team Joest with drivers Tom Kristensen and Rinaldo Capello.","Donington was also a venue for races in the FIA GT Championship in 1997-1999 and then 2002-2004.","Beside motorsports, many other events are held at Donington, including music festivals such as the Download Festival; and the Donington Grand Prix Museum exhibition until it closed down in November 2018.","The Donington Park Sunday Market used to be held in the grounds of the park for nearly 40 years before being closed down in September 2016, the owners citing changing shopping habits contributing to fewer traders and customers.","Donington Park has a long history of holding rock festivals having played host to the Monsters of Rock festival from 1980 to the mid 90s, when groups such as AC\/DC, Metallica and Iron Maiden  performed there.","With a few years off the park then played host to Stereophonics' A Day At The Races event and the Rock and Blues Festival in 2001, and the Ozzfest in 2002.","In 2003, the Download Festival (owned and operated by Live Nation) began annually at the venue and continues to an increased three-day event with five stages, though as of 2008 the event is now held outside of the track boundary.","Donington Park was the venue for the biggest rave to ever take place in the United Kingdom,

race track in Mexico City, Mexico, named after the racing drivers Ricardo and Pedro Rodr\u00edguez.","The circuit got its name shortly after it opened when Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez died in practice for the non-Championship 1962 Mexican Grand Prix.","Ricardo's brother Pedro was also killed behind the wheel nine years later.","Since 2015, the track has once again hosted the Formula One Mexican Grand Prix, an event it previously hosted in two separate periods on a different layout, the last occasion of which was in 1992.","The circuit is located within the public park of the Magdalena Mixhuca Sports City in southeast Mexico City.","The circuit is owned by the Government of the City, but is currently operated under concession by Corporaci\u00f3n Interamericana de Entretenimiento (CIE) through OCESA, one of CIE's subsidiaries.","CIE also organizes the NASCAR and Desaf\u00edo Corona races in this circuit and rents the circuits to other parties, including race organizers, automobile clubs and track amateurs for fees that are controversial due to their disproportionately high amounts compared to other ex-F1 courses.","The NASCAR Xfinity Series started racing at Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez in the 2005 season and ended in the 2008 season.","Martin Truex Jr. won the race in 2005, and Denny Hamlin won in 2006.","For the 2007 race, the chicane was removed to increase passing opportunities down the front straight and into turn 1, and Juan Pablo Montoya from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, won the race.","Kyle Busch was the winner of the race in 2008.","The A1 Grand Prix series started racing at Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez in the 2006\u201307 season using the full-track configuration used by Formula One.","Alex Yoong from Malaysia won the sprint race and Oliver Jarvis from the United Kingdom won the feature race.","In the 2007\u201308 season, Jonny Reid from New Zealand won the sprint race and Adam Carroll of Team Ireland won the feature race.","Built in the Magdalena Mixhuca public park in 1959, the circuit hosted its first Formula One Grand Prix in 1962, as a non-Championship race.","The following year the Mexican Grand Prix became a full World Championship event.","The circuit remained part of the F1 calendar through 1970, when spectator overcrowding caused unsafe conditions.","When F1 returned in 1986, the circuit boasted a new pit complex, as well as improved safety all around, but left again after 1992 due to safety concerns.","In 2001 CIE and Forsythe Racing tasked D3 Motorsport Development with revamping the circuit.","A redesign to include the Foro and a complete upgrade of the circuit was done.","It saw a record crowd of 402,413 people attend a round of the CART Championship in 2002.","It was announced in May 2012, that the circuit would again host the Mexican Grand Prix from 2013, in a five-year deal that would see it replace the European Grand Prix in Valencia, but this did not happen.","The FIA listed the Mexican Grand Prix as the 19th round of the provisional schedule for the 2014 season, but it was not on the finalized schedule.","The Mexican Grand Prix was listed on the 2015 Formula One calendar published by the FIA on 3 December 2014, with Formula One making its return to the circuit with the race on 1 November 2015.","The racetrack is also home to Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC Mexico), a music festival attended by over 200,000 people.","Designed as his thesis by student \u00d3scar Fern\u00e1ndez in 1953, the circuit has an elevation of 2,238m (7,342ft); the thin air causes difficulties for both the drivers and their cars.","It also reduces the levels of aerodynamic drag that cars experience, meaning that higher downforce setups can be used with less impact on straight-line speed.","The circuit has an extremely fast final corner (the Peraltada, turn 17) before a long start\/finish straight, and thus reminded some of Monza; however, unlike Monza's Parabolica curve, the Peraltada curve is slightly banked, allowing even more speed through the corner.","It was at this corner that the younger Rodr\u00edguez crashed, due to suspension failure.","After the last F1 Mexican Grand Prix in 1992, a baseball stadium called the \"Foro\" was built on the inner part of this curve.","When the Champ Car series began using the track in 2002, the Peraltada curve was partially bypassed by a series of sharp turns entering and exiting the Foro; re-entering the Peraltada halfway through.","After the Peraltada comes the long 1.2km front straight.","During the original turbo era in Formula One the faster cars were regularly clocking speeds of up to 330km\/h (205mph) on the straight.","In the 2005 NASCAR Busch Series season, there was a chicane on the main straightaway to slow the cars down.","They also introduced a curve between the short course and the Ese del Lago to bypass the latter, but avoiding the stadium detour.","The Grand Prix circuit underwent a significant renovation under the direction of Hermann Tilke for the return of Formula One in 2015.","The front straight was slightly extended and reprofiled to accommodate a new media center and paddock.","The iconic esses between turns 7 and 13 were significantly modified; the prolific, high radius turns largely diminished and some replaced with fixed angle turns.","The baseball field portion of the track was also altered to a low-speed left-right combination that bypassed the first half of the Peraltada, allowing the cars to re-enter the Peraltada halfway through the corner.","At 4.304 kilometres (2.674mi), the course is 170 metres (560ft) shorter than the previous Grand Prix layout, and Mexican Grand Prix organisers predicted lap times of around 75 seconds and speeds in excess of 328km\/h (204mph) for the current turbocharged Formula One cars, which eliminate the adverse effects of altitude present in naturally aspirated cars.","However, the modern V6 hybrid turbo F1 cars actually managed to reach top speeds in excess of 370km\/h (230mph) down the main straight.","The circuit also features an oval layout due to the inclusion of a flat turn that goes from the middle of the main straight to the beginning of the backstretch of circuit.","Unlike the road course, the oval is raced in counter-clockwise direction (except for the Formula E race).","The oval configuration of this Mexico City facility is arguably the most dangerous racetrack in Mexico, because of the limited visibility at the exit of turns 2 and 4.","This is because the Foro Sol baseball stadium is located inside turns 1 and 2; and several trees are located inside turns 3 and 4.","During the 2006 season, two accidents occurred in the oval track during NASCAR Mexico T4 Series events, which took several drivers out of the race, with some needing hospital treatment.","The oval configuration is used at least twice a year, with two double-feature events featuring the NASCAR Toyota Series and the NASCAR Mexico T4 Series.","The oval configuration also forms the base of the FIA Formula E Championship circuit for the Mexico City ePrix; the oval is raced clockwise, but there is a chicane prior to the entrance of turn 4, with a second chicane on the backstretch, followed by a modified Foro Sol section that exits for the full Peraltada, and a third chicane midway through the Peraltada (turns 1 and 2 of the oval).","FIA Formula E track design was modified by Agustin Delicado Zome\u00f1o.","Starting from season 3 (2016\u20132017), the first chicane is removed and now it is a right-hand corner.","In season 6, the track is extended and the two chicanes at the back straight and the Peraltada are removed.","The track also uses more of the Formula 1 layout.","After turn 2 (Formula E track), the track will turn left instead of right and the extended part includes a 4-turn sequence before going back to the original circuit and the stadium section.","Before the 1986 Formula One race, the first turn (now turns 1-3) was named in honor of Mois\u00e9s Solana, Mexico's third F1 driver.","It is still called Ese Mois\u00e9s Solana, often referred to as the \"Solana Complex\" in English.","In September 2002, Mexico's fourth and, then, last F1 driver H\u00e9ctor Alonso Rebaque a.k.a.","H\u00e9ctor Rebaque's achievements both in F1 and CART were recognised by naming turn 6 of the Autodromo in his honour and calling it Recorte Rebaque instead of the previous name of Recorte de Gran Premio.","In 2015 the turn 17 of the Autodromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez was baptized in honour of Formula One legend Nigel Mansell, twice winner of the Mexican Grand Prix of 1987 and 1992 and the scene of his daring pass around the outside of Gerhard Berger in 1990.","On September 20, 2016 Adri\u00e1n Fern\u00e1ndez's achievements have been recognized by the naming of turn 12 of the Autodromo in his honour.","The track hosts the FIA Formula One World Championship (Mexican Grand Prix) and the FIA Formula E World Championship (Mexico City ePrix).","It also hosts the Copa Turismo M\u00e9xico and Moto Pro M\u00e9xico series.","The

Indy Grand Prix race promoter.","The \"Phoenix Grand Prix Committee\" was established to negotiate with Ecclestone the terms for hosting the event but one immediate problem was that Detroit had a valid contract to host the US Grand Prix until 1991.","However, in October 1988, Detroit refused to invest money into improving Grand Prix facilities demanded by Ecclestone and decided to run an Indy car event instead of Formula 1 in 1989.","On January 13, 1989, the Phoenix City Council headed by mayor Terry Goddard agreed to stage an annual Formula 1 race on a five-year contract.","Phoenix City Council also voted to spend $9 million of taxpayers' money on race circuit infrastructure over the 5 years.","It was well known to organizers that Phoenix can be very hot during summer, but nonetheless, Phoenix inherited the Detroit race's scheduled slot of June 4, 1989.","The city had only 4 months to finish the 2.361mi (3.800km) long circuit.","This required fencing off and repaving the road surface, as well as building grandstands, garages for the pit crew, and other infrastructure.","The project was so massive that local media joked that the city looked as if it were preparing for a Soviet invasion.","In the inaugural race in 1989, Ayrton Senna took the pole in his McLaren-Honda but suffered an electronic failure a little over halfway through the race.","The heat of the Phoenix desert was hard on teams and drivers, and only 6 of 26 cars finished.","Alain Prost, Senna's teammate, won the race ahead of Riccardo Patrese and Phoenix native Eddie Cheever.","In an attempt

Phoenix hired Buddy Jobe, the owner of Phoenix International Raceway to be consultant for the city for the next event.","On October 7, 1991, however, Ecclestone called the City of Phoenix from his London office to say that Formula 1 would not be returning to Phoenix, giving no explanation as to why.","Phoenix City Manager David Garcia said that Ecclestone agreed to pay the city $1.2 million for cancellation of the contract, and that the reason for cancellation may have been a desire to add a South African Grand Prix since apartheid had ended.","During the 1992 South African Grand Prix, Ecclestone was asked whether poor attendance was to blame for the cancellation of the Phoenix race; Ecclestone replied that the issue was not the lack of spectators, but \"the inability to put more

building a racetrack.","The circuit has hosted the FIA Formula One French Grand Prix since 2018, having previously hosted it intermittently from 1971 to 1983, and every year from 1985 to 1990.","Opened on 19 April 1970, the circuit's innovative facilities made it one of the safest motor racing circuits in the world at the time of its opening.","The circuit had three track layout permutations, a large industrial park and an airstrip.","The combination of modern facilities, mild winter weather and an airstrip made it popular amongst racing teams for car testing during the annual winter off-season.","The original track was dominated by the 1.8km (1.1mi) long Mistral Straight that is followed by the high-speed right hand Signes corner.","The long main straight and other fast sections made the track very hard on engines as they ran at full revs for extended spells.","Engine failures were common, such as Ayrton Senna's huge crash during the 1985 French Grand Prix after the Renault engine in his Lotus failed and he went off backwards at Signes on his own oil and crashed heavily, with only light bruising to the driver.","Nigel Mansell crashed at the same place in the same weekend during practice and suffered a concussion which kept him out of the race.","Mansell's crash was the result of a slow puncture in his left rear tyre causing it to explode at over 320km\/h

pushed his turbocharged, 1,000bhp (746kW; 1,014PS) Brabham-BMW to 338km\/h (210mph).","This compared to the slowest car in the race, the 550bhp (410kW; 558PS) naturally aspirated Tyrrell-Ford V8 of Stefan Bellof which could only manage 277km\/h (172mph).","Bellof qualified 9 seconds slower than Surer and 12 seconds slower than pole winner Rosberg.","Paul Ricard was inaugurated with a 2-litre sports car race; during the 1970s and the 1980s the track developed some of the best French drivers of the time including four time World Drivers' Champion Alain Prost who won the French Grand Prix at the circuit in 1983, 1988, 1989 and 1990.","The circuit hosted the Formula One French Grand Prix on many occasions, the first of which was the 1971 French Grand Prix.","The circuit was also extensively used for testing, especially in Formula One.","In 1986, Brabham Formula One driver Elio de Angelis was killed in a testing accident at the fast first turn after the rear wing of his Brabham BT55 had broken off.","Although the circuit was not the cause of the crash, it was modified in order to make it safer.","The length of the Mistral Straight was reduced from 1.8km (1.1mi) in length to just over 1km (0.62mi), and the fast sweeping Verrerie curves where de Angelis had crashed were bypassed.","Effectively, after the start, instead of heading into the left hand Verrerie sweeper, cars now braked hard and turned sharp right into a short run that connected the pit straight to the Mistral.","This changed the circuit length for a Grand Prix from 5.809km (3.610mi) to just 3.812km (2.369mi).","This also had the effect of cutting lap times from Keke Rosberg's 1985 pole time of 1:32.462 in his Williams-Honda turbo, to Nigel Mansell's 1990 pole time of 1:04.402 in his V12 Ferrari.","The last French Grand Prix held at the circuit was in 1990; the event then moved to Magny-Cours where it ran until 2008.","Since then there were discussions about reviving the French Grand Prix with Paul Ricard one of the circuits believed to be considered as the venue.","During its life of hosting a round of the Formula One World Championship, Paul Ricard hosted the French Grand Prix on 14 occasions between 1971 and 1990.","The Long Circuit was used from 1971 to 1985, with the Club Circuit used from 1986 to 1990.","On six occasions (1971, 1975, 1976, 1978, 1980 and 1989) the winner at Paul Ricard went on to win the World Championship in the same year.","Ronnie Peterson (1973 and 1974) and Ren\u00e9 Arnoux (1982) are the only Ricard winners who never won the championship.","In the 1990s the circuit's use was limited to motorcycle racing and French national racing, most notably until 1999, the Bol d'or 24-hour motorcycle endurance race.","The track was also the home of the Oreca F3000 team.","After Ricard's death, the track was sold to Excelis, a company owned by Formula One promoter Bernie Ecclestone, in 1999.","The track was rebuilt into an advanced test track, and was for a time known as the Paul Ricard High Tech Test Track (Paul Ricard HTTT) before changing its name back to Circuit Paul Ricard.","An aircraft landing strip suitable for private jets is amongst the circuit's facilities.","There is a Karting Test Track (KTT) that features the same type of abrasive safety zones as the car track.","The track has also hosted some races, including the 2006 Paul Ricard 500km, a round of the FIA GT Championship.","Other GT championships have run races here, most notably the Ferrari Challenge and races organized by Porsche clubs of France and Italy.","On 5 December 2016, it was announced that the French Grand Prix would return to the Formula 1 calendar for the 2018 season at Paul Ricard.","It was the first French Grand Prix since 2008 (last held at Magny-Cours) and the first at Circuit Paul Ricard since 1990.","On 19 June 2017, the FIA's World Motor Sport Council in Geneva published its 2018 provisional calendar with the French Grand Prix scheduled for 24 June at Circuit Paul Ricard with the race itself followed immediately by the Austrian Grand Prix at the Red Bull Ring and then the British Grand Prix at Silverstone Circuit.","Pirelli Motorsport has planned for a two-day tyre testing for its 2018 Formula 1 tyres at Circuit Paul Ricard in the months of May, June and September 2017.","Paul Ricard has the 3-star FIA Environmental Accreditation.","In a 2021 report, it was ranked the second most sustainable racetrack in the world, together with Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya and behind Mugello Circuit.","The track is characterised by its 1.8km (1.1mi) long Mistral straight and elongated track design.","The track is also unusual in that it is built on a plateau: it is very flat.","In 1986 the track was modified to shorten the circuit, by adding shortcut through to the middle of the Mistral Straight.","This shorter circuit was also known as the GP short circuit and was 3.812km (2.369mi) long.","After the modifications in 2000-2005, the track offers 167 possible configurations from 0.826km (0.513mi) to the full 5.861km (3.642mi).","The track's elevation ranges from 408 to 441m (1,339 to 1,447ft) above sea level.","Its flexibility and mild winter weather mean that it is used for testing by several motorsport teams, including Formula One teams.","The track is known for its distinctive black and blue run-off areas known as the Blue Zone.","The runoff surface consists of a mixture of asphalt and tungsten, used instead of gravel traps, as common at other circuits.","A second, deeper run-off area is the Red Zone, with a more abrasive surface designed to maximize tyre grip and hence minimize braking distance, although at the cost of extreme tyre wear.","The final safeguard consists of Tecpro barriers, a modern improvement on tyre barriers.","In 2019 the pitlane entry was moved following safety concerns.","The entry, which was previously accessed via the main straight, is now situated

between M-Bridge Holdings and Jeollanam-do regional government).","By 2015, having only hosted four Grand Prix events and relegated to hosting modestly attended local races, the facility has been criticized as a debacle.","It was announced on 2 September 2009, that the funding was in place to start construction at the site, and officials were confident the work would be completed in time to hold a Grand Prix in 2010.","On 10 December 2009, the organisers of the event announced that they were on schedule, with a plan to finish the circuit on 5 July 2010, though they admitted that their largest problem lay in finding accommodation for all Formula One staff and spectators.","German designer Hermann Tilke was given the responsibility of the design of the track.","It is part permanent, part temporary.","The temporary part is along the harbour side of the province where spectators from the promenade, hotels and yachts can view the race.","Part of the city with possible exhibition facilities, shops, restaurants and cafes are utilized as the pit lane during the F1 Grand Prix weekend.","The initial contract has a duration of seven years, with a five-year option that could take the race until 2021.","The circuit planned to revive the Korea Super Prix in 2011, the Formula Three event, previous held at the Changwon City Raceway, last raced in 2003.","In the midst of speculation that the race would be aborted because the circuit would not be completed in time, organisers for the race announced the circuit's opening date to be 5 September 2010.","On 4 September 2010, in an event called \u2018Circuit Run 2010\u2019, a Red Bull Racing Formula 1 show car using a V10 version of the current Renault engine, with Karun Chandhok at the wheel, completed 14 laps of the all new Korean Formula One Grand Prix circuit.","Four thousand spectators travelled to the new track for the event.","The final track inspection was delayed multiple times.","Originally, the FIA technical delegates were due to inspect the circuit on 28 September 2010 in order to grant permission for F1 races to be held there, however the date was later moved to the 11 October, only 11 days before the first cars were scheduled to start first practice.","Following a two-day track inspection, FIA race director Charlie Whiting described the Yeongam circuit as \u2018satisfactory\u2019 and announced the mandatory license would be issued through the Korea Automobile Racing Association (KARA).","The inaugural Korean Grand Prix was run on 24 October for the 2010 Formula One season.","The event was the 17th out of 19 events during the season, after the Japanese Grand Prix at the Suzuka Circuit.","The capacity of the venue is 135,000 spectators.","According to the Chonnam Yeongam Korean Formula One Grand Prix circuit, around 77 million dollars (88 billion won) was needed for the construction cost of the circuit, the amount requested by the scholarship that was used in the 52.8 billion won.","However, it was difficult to secure the remaining 35.2 billion won, and it was reported that there would be virtually no prospect of government aid to the Formula 1 project by the Korean government.","The Korean circuit was included in the 2012 FIA GT1 World Championship calendar, but later it was removed.","It was announced in 2012 that the circuit would host an exhibition round of the 2013 Super GT season; the plans also fell through.","The GT Asia Series has raced frequently at Korea.","The circuit starts with a double left hander; the first corner is taken in second gear, with the drivers accelerating through the second turn.","This opens up onto a straight 1160meters long, which in turn feeds into the slowest corner on the circuit, a second-gear right-hand bend.","The cars follow a shorter straight, home to the support pits, before a series of tight switchbacks at turns four, five and six; all three are taken in second gear.","The circuit then opens up again, flowing through a series of fast fifth-gear bends, before the driver must brake for turn ten, a tight right-hander whose approach is made more difficult by the position of the braking zone on a downward-sloping incline.","The remainder of the circuit is modelled on a street circuit, and follows a labyrinth series of left and right-hand bends that lead to turn seventeen, a long right-hander that is completely blind as it is surrounded by walls.","The final turn on the circuit is a left-hand kink that feeds onto the main straight.","The pit lane has been controversial due to its entry and exit.","In 2010 the pit lane entry was deemed dangerous by drivers such as Robert Kubica because it is on the racing line on the exit of a 240km\/h corner, so cars pitting will be going significantly slower but still on the racing line.","Kubica stated \"it might be quite tight\" and Jarno Trulli said that he was \"worried about someone going into the back of him\" when he was forced to pit in because he was stuck in gear.","The wall at Turn 17 was moved back in 2011 to improve visibility at that part of the track, so drivers on a hot lap can see drivers slowing to go into the pits.","The pit lane exit has also been criticised as it fed into the outside of Turn 1, despite original plans for a pit exit running around the outside of the turns 1 and 2 run off area.","Although it was off the racing line, if drivers locked up at the turn and ran wide, they could hit someone exiting the pits.","This happened during practice for the 2011 Korean Grand Prix when Mercedes' Nico Rosberg ran wide and hit Toro Rosso's Jaime Alguersuari.","The exit was criticised by several drivers as well as Mercedes GP's team principal Ross Brawn.","He said 'I have to say it's a little frustrating, with a brand new circuit like this, that we have that problem.","Look at the number of cars that went off at turn one in first practice.","With wet, difficult conditions, I think it was 20 or 30.'","Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said it was 'an accident that was going to happen' given the poor design of the exit.'","Nico Rosberg and Jarno Trulli also felt that the exit 'needed to be improved'.","Following complaints from the drivers, the FIA installed a set of traffic lights at the end of the pit lane, warning drivers rejoining the race of cars approaching at race speeds.","Teams also employed the use of spotters to warn drivers (both racing and exiting the pits) of any cars in the pit lane.","For the 2013 Korean Grand Prix the pit exit was extended out around turn 1 to rejoin the circuit at the end of turn 2, as was on the original plans for the track.","The quality of the work has been called into question by many drivers, with many highlighting an uneven surface as being \"not the standard that it should be\".","This is due to the pit lane being extended through the run off area, which has a drainage system running through it.","Although completion of the circuit was due July 2010, excessive rainfall caused delays in soil improvement.","The delay of the construction caused the inspection by FIA to be delayed for 20 days to 11 October, 10 days before the Korean

Piquet (Nelson Piquet International RaceTrack), also known as Jacarepagu\u00e1 after the neighbourhood in which it was located, and also as the Aut\u00f3dromo Riocentro, was a motorsport circuit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.","Opened in 1977, it hosted the Formula One Brazilian Grand Prix on ten occasions, and was also used for CART, motorcycle racing and stock car racing.","In 2012, it was demolished to make way for facilities to be used at the 2016 Summer Olympics.","The original circuit was built between 1971 and 1977 on the site of the Barra da Tijuca road course, which had itself been built on reclaimed marshland and was operational from 1964 to 1970.","It was a relatively flat circuit, with a long pit straight and a longer back straight (which allowed the turbo-engined Formula One cars of the mid-1980s to reach speeds of 300 km\/h (186 mph)), and numerous mid- to slow-speed corners with plenty of room for overtaking.","The maximum spectator capacity was 90,000.","With the exception of the 1978 race, the Formula One Grand Prixs were held in March or April in Rio's very hot and humid tropical early autumn weather.","The first Brazilian Grand Prix at the circuit took place shortly after opening, in 1978, and was won by Argentina's Carlos Reutemann in a V12 Ferrari 312T3 in the oppressive heat and humidity of Rio's January summer season, after Sweden's Ronnie Peterson had taken pole position in the revolutionary ground-effect Lotus 78-Ford.","After the 1979 and 1980 races had been held at the Interlagos circuit in S\u00e3o Paulo, the F1 circus left the 5-mile Interlagos circuit due to safety concerns with the circuit and the growing slums of the circuit's surrounding areas being at odds with Formula One's new glamour image.","Rio's beaches and beautiful scenery were more suited to this new image, and the Brazilian Grand Prix was then held at Jacarepagu\u00e1 for the remainder of the 1980s.","The 1981 race was held in very wet conditions and was again won by Reutemann, this time driving a Williams FW07C-Ford, and in controversial circumstances: he disobeyed the team's orders to let teammate and then-reigning World Champion, Australia's Alan Jones, take the win.","The 1982 race, held at the height of the FISA\u2013FOCA war, was also shrouded in controversy.","Rio born driver Nelson Piquet, who had won the World Championship the year before, finished first in a Brabham BT49-Ford, with Finland's Keke Rosberg second in a Williams FW07C-Ford.","However, both drivers were disqualified for being underweight, having raced with \"water-cooled brakes\".","This promoted Alain Prost, third in the turbocharged Renault RE30, to the win, the first of an eventual five for the Frenchman at the circuit and start a streak of 7 straight wins for turbo powered cars at the circuit until the original turbo era ended following the 1988 season.","The disqualifications, however, prompted most FOCA-aligned teams \u2013 including Brabham and Williams \u2013 to boycott the San Marino Grand Prix two races later.","However, unlike the 1980 Spanish Grand Prix where the factory teams of Ferrari, Renault and Alfa Romeo (all who were on the FISA side of the war) boycotted the race and the results were eventually voided, the 1982 San Marino Grand Prix results without the FOCA teams were counted.","Piquet and Rosberg again crossed the line first and second in the 1983 race, although this time only Rosberg was disqualified, having had a push start in the pits after his Williams FW08-Ford caught fire.","Unusually, the drivers below Rosberg were not promoted accordingly.","The win was the first of two wins at the circuit for Piquet, who would go on to win his second World Championship that year.","Piquet won the race in his Brabham-BMW turbo and went on to be the first ever F1 World Champion to be powered by a turbocharged engine.","From 1983 until 1989, the Brazilian Grand Prix was the opening race of the season.","Both the 1984 and 1985 races were won by Prost, now racing a McLaren-TAG.","The 1984 race also saw the debut of Ayrton Senna, driving a Toleman TG183-Hart where he had the unfortunate 'honour' of being the first retirement of the 1984 season.","Piquet won the 1986 race in a Williams FW11-Honda, with Senna making it a Brazilian 1\u20132 in a Lotus 98T-Renault, before Prost beat Piquet to win the 1987 race in a McLaren MP4\/3-TAG.","After Piquet won his third (and final) World Championship in 1987, the circuit was named after him in 1988.","However, he had to settle for third in a Lotus 100T-Honda in that year's race, as Prost once again won in a McLaren MP4\/4-Honda.","1988 was the last year of the original turbo era in Formula One.","For Prost it was his 5th win in 9 races at the circuit.","The 1989 race was the first to be held following the banning of turbo engines, and Great Britain's Nigel Mansell took a surprise win in his V12 powered Ferrari 640, complete with Formula 1's first semi-automatic gearbox.","Another Brazilian driver, Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin, finished third in a March 881-Judd (Prost finished second), while Senna, who had won his first World Championship the year before, set the fastest ever lap of the circuit in qualifying with a time of 1:25.302 to take pole position in a V10 McLaren MP4\/5-Honda.","After winning the race, Mansell joked that with the Ferrari's known reliability problems at the time he had booked an early flight out of Rio in anticipation of a short race for him.","In 1990, the Brazilian Grand Prix moved to a shortened Interlagos, where it has been held ever since.","From 1996 to 2000 the CART series staged events at Jacarepagu\u00e1 in an accessory trapezoid-shaped speedway named \"Emerson Fittipaldi Speedway\", having approximately 3.000km (1.864mi) length.","The race, originally the Rio 400, before being shortened to the Rio 200 in 1999, was first won in 1996 by Brazilian Andr\u00e9 Ribeiro.","The circuit qualifying record for the Emerson Fittipaldi Speedway was set by Emerson's own nephew Christian Fittipaldi with a time of 38.565 (280km\/h or 174mph) for the 3.000km (1.864mi) track.","The long back straight of the road course which had grandstands running its entire 900 metre length became the front straight of the Speedway, with the pits located in the area between the straight and the pit straight of the road course.","The circuit also hosted the Rio de Janeiro motorcycle Grand Prix race from 1995 to 2004.","Italy's nine time World Champion Valentino Rossi won the most races, winning four from 2000\u20132003, while Australian five-time World Champion Michael Doohan won the 1996 and 1997 races.","The first Rio Motorcycle Grand Prix was won by Italian Luca Cadalora, riding a Yamaha YZR500.","The final race held at the circuit in 2004, was won by Japanese rider Makoto Tamada riding a Honda RC211V.","Honda won seven of the nine Rio Grands Prix held, with Yamaha winning two.","The circuit held the Mil Milhas Brasil endurance race in 1997.","Until 2012 the circuit was also a host in the South American Formula Three Championship, namely the Formula 3 Sudamericana.","As of early 2005, there were plans to partially demolish this racetrack to make room for a new sports complex to be used for the 2007 Pan American Games.","It would have made the track approximately 3.336km (2.073mi) long, thus making it too short for most international racing series.","However, the FIA's ruling on a track's minimum length is ambiguous.","In 2006, despite rumors of the race being cancelled, the Brazilian Stock Car Rio event was contested on a temporary short circuit combining sections of the oval and normal circuits and the start\/finish line was moved to the back stretch, which was cut short to make room for the Pan-American games venues.","Another proposal for the circuit was to have both a club permanent circuit, and an international-length half-permanent, half-car park circuit involving that circuit and an extension which utilises the car parks of the park.","That would have been designed by Hermann Tilke.","In January 2008 it was announced that the track was to be demolished to allow the city to build an Olympic Training Centre venue for the Rio de Janeiro bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics which Rio was successful in winning.","As of 2008, the 3.336km (2.073mi) track comprised the original circuit's second half with a hairpin that connects the previous main straight and back straight.","It remained active, with races such as Stock Car's Corrida do Milh\u00e3o.","The track and adjacent motorsport facilities were finally demolished in November 2012 to make way for new facilities to be used during the 2016 Summer Olympics.","In March 2013 Bernie Ecclestone, CEO of the Formula One Group, said discussions were taking place for the Formula 1 Grand Prix to move from the Interlagos Circuit in S\u00e3o Paulo to Rio de Janeiro and a suitable time for this could be 2016, coinciding with the 2016 Olympic Games.","Formula 1 last raced at Rio in 1989 before returning to S\u00e3o Paulo in 1990, where it has

racing, and later CART racing, between the 1982 and 1991 seasons.","The street circuit (course) was set up near the Renaissance Center and the Cobo Arena, also including a small part of the M-1 highway, also known as Woodward Avenue.","It is a flat circuit, with elevation ranging from 176 to 184 metres above sea level.","The Detroit street circuit's place in Formula One history was assured when Michele Alboreto won the 1983 race driving a Tyrrell 011.","This was the last of 155 Grand Prix wins for the 3.0L Cosworth DFV V8 engine, dating back to its debut at the 1967 Dutch Grand Prix in the hands of dual World Champion Jim Clark.","It was also the last of 23 Formula One race wins for Tyrrell, who had won their first Grand Prix at the 1971 Spanish Grand Prix with that year's World Champion Jackie Stewart driving the Tyrrell 003.","The race soon gained a reputation for being horrendously demanding and gruelling, with the very bumpy track often breaking up badly under the consistently hot weather.","It was perhaps the single hardest race on both car and driver in Formula One during the 1980s, often producing races of attrition in which a large number of cars would retire due to mechanical breakage or contact with the narrow concrete walls.","Brakes and gearboxes in particular were tested to their breaking points - the drivers had to brake hard more than 20 times per lap and change gear around 50 to 60 times in one lap (cars still had manual gearboxes in those days), for 62 laps usually lasting around 1 minute and 45 seconds.","At least half the field retired in each race; it was thus considered an achievement if a driver could even finish the race, let alone win it.","The 1984 race, won by reigning World Champion Nelson Piquet, tied an F1 road course record by featuring 20 retirements.","Shortly after the race, impurities were found in the water injection system of Martin Brundle's Tyrrell, causing him to be stripped of his 2nd-place finish and Tyrrell (by then the only team still using the naturally-aspirated DFV) to be disqualified from the entire 1984 season.","The race's five classified finishers (discounting Brundle) is beaten only by the 1966 Monaco Grand Prix.","By 1985, Detroit was the sole American venue on the F1 calendar - Las Vegas had been dropped after 1982, Long Beach switched to Champ Car for 1984, and a new event in Dallas only lasted one year after the heat and deteriorating track conditions almost saw it cancelled on the morning of the race.","That year saw Ayrton Senna take pole position, and he went on to enjoy substantial success at the circuit, winning the 1986, 1987, and 1988 races there, as well as taking further pole positions in 1986 and 1988.","The track was only moderately received by the drivers, and was disliked especially by world champions Alain Prost and Nelson Piquet.","Despite his open dislike of the track, Prost did finish second in 1988, and third in 1986 and 1987 (all for McLaren).","Piquet, who generally disliked street circuits (with the exception of the faster and more open Adelaide circuit in Australia), won at Detroit in 1984 and came second to Senna in 1987.","Embarrassingly, Piquet hit the wall during practice for the 1988 race when he spun his Lotus-Honda into the wall coming out of turn 1.","At the time, the Lotus had been carrying an onboard camera for some recorded laps.","The 1988 race, similar to the failed Dallas event, was extremely hot, and the circuit broke up very badly due to the intense heat and humidity.","After the race, the drivers were far more vocal in their criticism of the track, with race winner Senna comparing driving on the crumbled surface to driving in heavy rain.","1988 subsequently proved to be the last F1 race in Detroit, as the sport's governing body FISA ruled that its temporary pit area wasn't up to the required standard for a World Championship race.","The United States Grand Prix moved to another street circuit in Phoenix, Arizona, while the Detroit event became a CART race.","Starting in 1984, the SCCA Trans-Am Series held a support race during the Grand Prix weekend.","The Motor City 100 was often regarded as one of the most important events of the Trans-Am schedule due to the increased television and sponsor exposure, made possible by the international broadcast of the Grand Prix.","The Trans-Am race wasn't popular with the Formula One drivers though with the heavy and powerful Trans-Am cars with their huge rear wheels having a tendency to break up the track, already in a suspect state thanks to the heat of the summer when the races were scheduled.","This often made the Grands Prix a more difficult prospect due to drivers having to go offline on to the 'dirty' part of the road to avoid problem areas on the track surface.","Three CART races were held on the track which was altered slightly with the removal of the unpopular chicane immediately prior to the pits.","Emerson Fittipaldi won the first and last races and Michael Andretti won the second race; Andretti also won pole position for each Detroit race.","The final race featured an unusual lack of attrition as nearly 3\/4 of the drivers finished.","The race was not economically viable for the city, so the venue was changed to a temporary course on Belle Isle for the 1992 season.","That event lasted until 2001 as a CART event and was briefly revived for the 2007 and 2008 American Le Mans Series and IndyCar Series seasons, and then again from 2012 onwards.","It was approved on November 3, 2021 that the

proximity of the Grand Prix loop to local residents mean that the number of race meetings held on the extended circuit are limited to just a few per year (usually for higher-profile series such as the BTCC and the BSB).","The full Grand Prix circuit begins on the Brabham Straight, an off-camber, slightly curved stretch, before plunging into the right-hander at Paddock Hill Bend, with gradients of 8%.","Despite the difficulty of the curve, due to the straight that precedes it, it is one of the track's few overtaking spots.","The next corner, Druids, is a hairpin bend, negotiated after an uphill braking zone at Hailwood Hill.","The track then curves around the south bank spectator area into the downhill, off-camber Graham Hill Bend, and another, slightly bent stretch at the Cooper Straight, which runs parallel to the pit lane.","After the straight, the circuit climbs uphill though the decreasing-radius Surtees turn, before moving onto the back straight where the track's top speeds can be reached.","The most significant elevation changes on the circuit occur here at Pilgrim's Drop and Hawthorn Hill, which leads into Hawthorn Bend (with some parts approaching 7%).","The track then loops around the woodland with a series of mid-speed corners, most notably the dip at Westfield and Dingle Dell and the blind Sheene curve.","From there the track then emerges from the left hand and cambered Stirlings Bend onto the short straight to Clearways and rejoins the Indy Circuit for Clark Curve with its uphill off-camber approach to the pit straight and the start\/finish line.","The British Rallycross Circuit at Brands Hatch was designed and constructed by four-times British Rallycross Champion Trevor Hopkins.","It is approximately 0.9 miles (1.4km) long and was completed around 1981.","Unlike earlier rallycross courses at Brands Hatch, cars start on the startline then veer right and downhill on the loose at Paddock Hill Bend.","Through the left-right Esses at the bottom, the circuit rejoins the Indy Circuit to travel up and round Druids hairpin, before a 90-degree left through Langley's Gap and across the knife-edge, rejoining the Indy Circuit, but travelling anti-clockwise.","From Cooper Straight, the cars swoop up the old link road and back to Paddock.","Brands Hatch was originally the name of a natural grassy hollow that was shaped like an amphitheatre.","Although the site was originally used as a military training ground, the fields belonging to Brands Farm were first used as a circuit by a group of Gravesend cyclists led by Ron Argent, with the permission of the local farmer and landowner, Harry White.","Using the natural contours of the land, many cyclists from around London practised, raced and ran time trials on the dirt roads carved out by farm machinery.","The first actual race on the circuit was held in 1926, over 4 miles (6.4km) between cyclists and cross-country runners.","Within a few years, motorcyclists were using the circuit, laying out a three-quarter-mile anti-clockwise track in the valley.","They also saw the advantage of competing in a natural arena just a few hundred yards from the A20, and with the passage of time, a kidney-shaped circuit came into use.","The first motorcycle races were \"very informal\" with much of the organisation being done on the spot.","Initially the racing was on a straight strip approximately where Cooper Straight came to be when the track was tarmacked.","Brands Hatch remained in operation during the 1930s, but after being used as a military vehicle park and being subject to many bombing raids during World War II, it needed much work before it could become a professional racing circuit.","In 1932, four local motorcycling clubs joined forces (Bermondsey, Owls, Sidcup and West Kingsdown) and staged their first meeting that March.","Motorcycle racing quickly resumed after World War II and in 1947, Joe Francis (managing director of Brands Hatch Stadium Ltd.) persuaded the BBC to televise a grass track meeting, the first motorcycle event to be televised on British TV.","Following World War II, cinders were laid on the track of what was by then known as Brands Hatch Stadium and motorcycle racing continued.","That was until 1950 when the 500 Club managed to persuade Joe Francis, that the future for his stadium lay in car and motorcycle road racing.","The group behind 500 c.c.","single-seater racing cars was the 500 Club and it, together with the owners, invested the sum of \u00a317,000 on a tarmac surface.","Thus Brands Hatch was born as a motor racing venue, and on 16 April 1950, the opening meeting was scheduled for the first purpose-built post-war racing circuit in England, approval having been given by the RAC following a demonstration by a handful of 500s in February.","Amongst those giving the demonstration was a very young Stirling Moss.","The Half-Litre Car Club for 500cc Formula 3 organised that first race on 16 April, with 7,000 spectators coming to witness these cars complete in 10 races.","The first victory went to a man who was to become a legend in Formula 3, Don Parker.","Before the year was out, five meetings had been held, with the events running to a similar programme.","The June meeting was a Moss benefit for he won all five races he entered in the Works Cooper and a set a new lap record.","The August Bank Holiday meeting saw for the first time, involvement of the national press with the Daily Telegraph sponsoring the main event of the day.","The old cinder track had been 0.75-mile (1.21km) in length, but the tarmac circuit was lengthened to 1-mile (1.6km) and now ran anticlockwise.","The Maidstone & Mid-Kent Motor Club invited a number of sports car drivers to test the circuit on 5 November, this being the first time that any car other than a 500cc had used it, and they ran clockwise.","In 1951, season included seven car meetings, all for Formula 3 and they were again organised the Half-Litre Car Club to which the 500 Club had changed its name since becoming a Limited Company.","In February, the Aston Martin Owners Club tested some 1.5-litre sports cars at Brands Hatch preparatory to the full International season starting.","The 1952 season saw the emergence of Stuart Lewis-Evans.","Les Leston raised the lap record to 71.15mph (50.6sec) \u2013 the first time that 70mph had been exceeded.","1953 saw the introductions of raised spectator protection banks.","This was to be Parker's year for he won the Autosport Formula 3 Championship taking seven races at Brands on his way the title.","Some 50,000 people packed into the Daily Telegraph International and as the season came to an end Parker raised the lap record to 74.38mph (48.4secs).","During 1953, the Universal Motor Racing Club was established, with a racing school set up at Brands Hatch.","The Half Litre Club, later to become the British Racing and Sports Car Club (BRSCC), ran many races throughout the 1950s and firmly established the venue as one of Britain's top racing circuits.","The track continued to expand during 1953 and 1954, with the addition of Druids Bend (lengthening the circuit to 1.24miles), a pit lane and spectator banks and reversing the racing direction to clockwise.","While Formula III racing was unquestionably close and exciting, it did have its limitations and now the paying public wanted some variety and more powerful cars to watch.","The change in direction of racing traffic resulted in the creation of Paddock Hill Bend a fast sweeping downhill right-hander.","At the bottom the Paddock Hill, a quarter-mile extension to the circuit was added which took the competitors up the other side of the valley to a right-hand hairpin, which is called Druids Hill Bend.","This new section re-joined the old track at another tricky corner, Bottom Bend, and the result was a circuit lengthened to 1.24-mile (2.00km).","The first race winner on the revised track was Stuart Lewis-Evans, at the wheel of a Cooper-Norton Mk.8, with a new name at the inaugural meeting.","That name was N. G. Hill who was a 'graduate' of the racing school.","As the season progressed larger engine machines began to appear starting with small and medium capacity sport cars, then Formula Libre machines.","However, most races were still run for Formula 3 and 1954 saw the first of what was to become the traditional Boxing Day meeting down in Kent.","A total of 15,000 spectators arrived at the Christmas meeting to watch a programme of seven races with the added attraction of ox-roasting and Stirling Moss.","It was Jim Russell's year, for he dominated the Formula 3, winning the Autosport National Championship, as well as four of the meeting .","Cooper T39s and Lotus Mk.9s dominated sports car racing while Archie Scott Brown had a stranglehold on the over 1,900 cc class, driving either the works Lister-Bristol or Louis Manduca's Jaguar C-Type.","At the August Bank Holiday meeting spectators could avail themselves of the only permanent grandstand at a British motor sport circuit; it had been purchased second-hand from the defunct Northolt pony-trotting stadium and for the 1956 season, a telephone system was installed linking race control, the grandstand and the marshals' posts, while a modern hospital was opened at the circuit, complete with operating theatre.","As larger-capacity cars become more common, 500 cc racing began to decline, but the formula still gave close, exciting racing.","The first year that public car race meeting were organised by other than the BRSCC was 1956 \u2013 in June, the 750 Motor Club joined forces with the Club Lotus to offer a mixture of races, including, for the first time at Brands, saloon cars.","This was also the year the Brands grew up, running Formula One cars for the first time on 14 October.","Initially, a long-distance race was planned, but in the end a 15-lap race was run which attracted four work entries from Connaught (B-Types for Archie Scott Brown, Les Leston, Jack Fairman and Stuart Lewis-Evans) opposed by privately entered Maserati 250Fs driven by Roy Salvadori and Bruce Halford and a selection of independents.","Archie won from Lewis-Evans, with Salvadori setting a new lap record in the process at a speed of 75.66mph.","Politics caused the cancellation of the Boxing Day meeting that year due to the Suez Crisis.","As a result of Suez affair, forecasts for 1957 season were gloomy, but the programme ran as planned, the two feature meeting of the year being run for the new Formula Two on Whit Sunday and August Bank Holiday.","The year saw a continued diversification at BRSCC meetings with fewer 500cc events and more sport-racing machinery.","The Kentish 100 was the biggest event yet run at the circuit for Formula Two with two 42-lap heats and attracted a truly International field.","Formula Two featured at other meetings but at the August Bank Holiday meeting, Formula 3 proved that it was not yet dead as it was run as the feature event for the Daily Telegraph Trophy.","Jim Clark made his Brands Hatch debut at the Boxing Day event, when he drove the Border Reivers-entered Lotus Elite into second place behind Colin Chapman.","At the August Bank Holiday meeting in 1958, an 1,100cc sports car became the first to lap Brands Hatch in under a minute.","Its creator had been unable to afford to purchase a Lotus, so had designed his own car; the car was called a Lola and its creator was Eric Broadley.","The highlight of the 1959 season was again the Kentish 100, with no less than 40 drivers (including 10 Grand Prix names) fighting for just 16 grid positions.","Jack Brabham won both 42-lap heats driving the works Cooper-Climax.","The feature race at the Boxing Day meeting was for Formula Junior, a new International Formula for single-seater racing cars using production engines up to 1,100 cc; works entries were received from Elva, Gemini, Lola, Cooper and Lotus.","This new formula was to prove the death-knell of 500 cc racing.","The new track was planned to be completed in time for the August Bank Holiday meeting and was ready for testing in June.","The debut of the new track came in August as planned, with work entries from BRM, Cooper, Ferrari, and Lotus together with independents such Yeoman Credit Racing, Scuderia Eugenio Castellotti and Scuderia Centro Sud.","Record traffic jams were reported on the A20 and the resultant huge crowd saw, the non-championship Silver City Trophy Formula One race, won by Jack Brabham in the works Cooper-Climax win by just 4.4 seconds from Graham Hill in the BRM P48, after the gearbox of Jim Clark's Lotus expired after leading 22 of the 50-lap race.","The fastest lap was set jointly by Clark and Brabham, in 1min 40.6sec, at a speed of 94.82mph.","Clark had his revenge a few weeks later when the circuit saw Formula Two cars performing in the Kentish 100 with a hard-fought win over Dan Gurney; both were driving Lotus-Climaxes, Clark's was a works car and Gurney's a private entry.Soon after, the track was sold to Grovewood Securities Ltd., and John Webb put in charge of Motor Circuit Developments to manage the circuit.","This was the year of the new 1.5-litre Formula One and on 3 June 1961, the Silver City Trophy, was contested over 76 laps of the GP Circuit by Grand Prix cars.","Entries were received from Cooper, Lotus, BRM, UDT-Laystall and Yeoman Credit.","Victory went to Stirling Moss driving the pale green UDT-Laystall Lotus 18\/21 Climax from Jim Clark abroad the works Lotus 21 Climax and Tony Brooks driving the BRM P57 Climax.","The 7 August meeting saw the Guards International Trophy for Intercontinental Formula cars.","In effect the redundant 2.5-litre F1 cars from pre-1961.","The race was a 76-lap affair over the GP Circuit; Jack Brabham won in the works Cooper T53-Climax from Jim Clark (works Lotus 18-Climax) and Graham Hill (BRM P57).","The following year 1962 did not see any major meetings at Brands, but on 1 October, the longest race staged so far took place.","This was the Motor-sponsored Six-Hour Saloon race.","The field of 35 entries included some foreign entrants and victory went to Mike Parkes and Jimmy Blumer driving a 3.8-litre Jaguar Mk II; the German pairing of Peter Lindner and Peter N\u00f6cker in another Jaguar from a Mini-Cooper driven by John Alvy and Denny Hulme, a New Zealand mechanic employed by Jack Brabham.","The Club Circuit had six meeting during 1962, and witnessed the coming of Formula Junior.","At the Easter Monday meeting, a Formula Junior race saw the lap record tumble to 55.6secs and the first-ever 80mph lap (actual speed was 80.29mph) by John Fenning, abroad a Lotus 20-Ford.","The 'Trio' meeting in July saw the end of an era when a 500 took the chequered flag for the last time with Mike Ledbrook, driving a Cooper-Norton Mark 8 in the 500 and 250cc race.","At the Boxing Day meeting, Hulme won the Formula Junior race driving the prototype Brabham BT6-Ford, setting a new outright lap record at 54.8secs (82.06mph).","The winter of 1962\/63 was severe, causing the cancellation of most sport, which resulted in empty television screens on occasions.","The lack of sport to show, virtually created Rallycross for on 9 February a rallycross-type event was staged on the slushy Brands Hatch car parks in front of the TV cameras (not the Rallycross Circuit used in the 1980s and 1990s).","The event had been quickly organised by Raymond Baxter of the BBC and the London Motor Club, and saw Timo M\u00e4kinen win easily in the works Austin-Healey 3000.","The second Motor-sponsored Six-Hour saloon car race, was a round on the inaugural European Touring Car Challenge.","It was run in appalling conditions on 6 July.","The large crowd witness the favourite, a 7-litre Ford Galaxie driven by Dan Gurney and Jack Brabham floundered in the wet and the Jaguar dominated the race.","Victory went to Roy Salvadori and Denny Hulme from Peter Linder and Peter N\u00f6cker after the winners on the road, Mike Salmon and Pete Sutcliffe being disqualified for engine irregularities.","The Guards Trophy was run for sports cars and went to Roger Penske driving his Zerex Special, which was based on a Cooper F1 chassis.","The British Grand Prix came to Kent in 1964 and was to be shared with Silverstone in alternate years until 1986.","Also the race was given the courtesy title European Grand Prix and the management rose to the occasion.","The date was 11 July, a cool and dry day which saw Jim Clark at his best in the Lotus 25 winning by 2.8secs from Graham Hill in the BRM P261, who was followed home by John Surtees in the V8 Ferrari 158; fourth and one lap down was Jack Brabham driving a car bearing his own name.","A further lap down in fifth place was Lorenzo Bandini in the V6 Ferrari with Phil Hill taking the final World Championship point in a Cooper.","The race average was 94.14mph and Clark set the fastest lap at 1min 38.8secs (96.5mph).","The Motor Six Hours had its third and final running on 6 June (still a round of the ETCC), with victory going to the Alan Mann-entered Lotus-Cortinas of Sir John Whitmore\/Peter Proctor and Henry Taylor\/Peter Harper.","The 1964 season was the busiest so far for Brands Hatch, with 14 car race meeting alone; the British Automobile Racing Club (BARC) organised its first meeting in Kent, while the London Motor Car Club organised one in June.","The year's Guards Trophy went to Bruce McLaren driving for Cooper in a 3.9-litre Oldsmobile-powered sports car.","With the Grand Prix not due back at Brands until 1966, they promoted a non-championship Formula One race to be known as Race of Champions sponsored by Daily Mail.The race was run in two 40-lap heats with victory going to Jim Clark (Lotus 33), while his teammate Mike Spence, won the second and taking the overall victory.","The first 100mph lap was set by Clark in 1min 35.4secs.","The longest race ever run at the Kentish Circuit took place on 22\/23 May, this being the Guards 1000 consisting of two 500-mile races for production saloon cars.","The overall winner was the works MG MGB of John Rhodes and Warwick Banks.","The British Grand Prix returned in 1966, the inaugural year of the 3-litre Formula One.","The works Brabham-Repco BT19 were first and second in the hands of Jack Brabham and Denny Hulme;

John Surtees won the Guards Trophy on August Bank Holiday Monday driving the 6-litre Lola T70.","The Motor Show 200 for Formula Two cars saw a young Austrian named Jochen Rindt win in the Roy Winkelmann-entered Brabham BT18.","The 1967 Race of Champions (still sponsored by Daily Mail) saw the first of two major victories by American cars at Brands when Dan Gurney brought the Eagle-Weslake T1G over the line first by 0.8 seconds from Lorenzo Bandin's Ferrari 312\/67.","So good was the public's response to the race (run in two 10-lap heats and a 40-lap final) that John Webb decided to make the race an annual event.","The other great American victory was to come when the be-winged 7-litre Chaparral 2F-Chevrolet driven by Phil Hill and Mike Spence won the BOAC 500 run over 211 laps of the Grand Prix Circuit at an average speed of 93.08mph, from the Ferrari 330-P4 of Chris Amon and Jackie Stewart.","These two had lapped the rest of the field twice, third place going to the Jo Siffert\/Bruce McLaren Porsche 910.","The year saw many firsts; in July, Tetsu Ikuzawa became the first Japanese ever to win a race in Britain, the first Mini Festival was run at Whitsun and the Mini-Seven Club ran the first ever all-saloon car meeting in February.","But the biggest 'first 'was the arrival of Formula Ford which was to become the providing ground and starting place for so many drivers.","The first Formula Ford race was run on 7 July and was won by Roy Allan in a Lotus 51.","It was March 1968 at a minor club meeting when 17-year-old racer Barry Sheene lined up on the starting grid, on a works 125cc Bultaco, for his first race.","It was an impressive debut by anyone's standards.","Sheene had worked his way up to second place and threatening the leader, Mike Lewis, when the bike seized and spat its rider off over the handlebars.","A rostrum position in the day's 250cc race was a great achievement, but an even better was not very far away.","Just one week later, and again at Brands, Sheene took his first race win, and he did it is style by an incredible 12 seconds.","And the best was yet to come, for he dominated a field of 350cc machines, riding special 250cc Bultaco (with an enlarged 280cc capacity).","The Manufacturers' World Championship came to Brands in early 1968, followed by the BOAC 500 on 7 April.","The winner was the Ford GT40 Mk.1 of Jacky Ickx and Brian Redman from the Porsche 908 of Gerhard Mitter and Ludovico Scarfiotti, these two being the only cars to complete the full race distance of 218-laps.","Two laps further down in third was another 907 driven by Vic Elford and Jochen Neerpasch and fourth place went to another GT40, driven by Paul Hawkins and David Hobbs.","Three months later came the British Grand Prix on 20 July, won by Jo \"Seppi\" Siffert.","Siffert's victory was noteworthy in that he won in a Lotus 49B which was delivered new to the circuit on the first morning of the meeting.","It was completed in the paddock and was entered by the Walker-Durlacher team \u2013 a private entrant winning a Grand Prix.","In second place just 4.4 secs behind was Chris Amon (Ferrari), with his teammate Jacky Ickx third.","Fourth was Denny Hulme in a McLaren M7A, from Surtees in the Honda RA300 one lap down, and Jackie Stewart a further lap down in the Matra-Ford MS80.","Easter Monday 1969 saw another brainchild of John Webb and the BRSCC's Competitions Director Nick Syreett come to fruition.","This was Formula 5000 which was based upon the American Formula A, the cars being single-seater chassis powered by American V8 and V6 stock-block engines of up to 5-litre capacity.","The need for the new formula was caused by the escalating costs of Formula Three, Formula Two and the decreasing number of non-championship Formula One events as more and more countries demanded a Grand Prix.","The winner of the first Formula 5000 race was Peter Gethin driving a McLaren M10A with Chevrolet power.","Indianapolis-style single-car qualifying was introduced for the 1969 Race of Champions, but it simply did not catch on \u2013 perhaps it did not have the glamour of the Indy 500; Jackie Stewart won the race in the Matra MS80 owned by Ken Tyrrell and went on to win his first World Championship with it.","The BOAC 500 was once again the British round of the Manufacturers' World Championship and was a Porsche benefit, 908s taking the first three places, the winners being Jo Siffert and Brian Redman; the second place car of Vic Elford and Richard Attwood was two laps behind, with Gerhard Mitter and Udo Sch\u00fctz third.","The International race calendar for 1970 opened with the Race of Champions.","March Engineering made its Formula One-winning debut when Jackie Stewart won driving Ken Tyrrell's March-Cosworth 701.","The British Grand Prix returned to Brands Hatch on 19 July and saw victory go to Jochen Rindt by less than 33 seconds from Jack Brabham, who had run out of fuel.","The Austrian driver of the Lotus was then disqualified following a protest over an aerofoil, but was reinstated before the evening was out.","Third place went to Denny Hulme in the McLaren from the Ferrari of Clay Regazzoni; a lap down in fifth spot with the March of Chris Amon with Graham Hill sixth in the other Lotus.","Rindt's winning speed was 108.69mph.","Although the World Championship sports race was now BOAC 1000, but measured in kilometres, not miles, it was another Porsche benefit, the fearsome 917s taking the first three places from a 908; the first car home was the Pedro Rodr\u00edguez\/Leo Kinnunen car from Vic Elford\/Denny Hulme and Richard Attwood\/Hans Herrmann.","The 908 was driven by Gijs van Lennep and Hans Laine.","The race was run over 235 laps at a speed of 92.15mph.","By 1971, the ownership of Brands Hatch was in the hands of Motor Circuit Developments (MCD), which saw the arrival of another MCD-inspired single-seater formula in the shape of Formula Atlantic.","The BOAC 1000 saw Alfa Romeo take their first major success in 20 years, with the chequered flag being taken by the 33TT3 of Andrea de Adamich and Henri Pescarolo, who completed the 235 laps at a speed of 97.17mph.","They were followed home by the Ferrari 312PB of Jacky Ickx and Clay Regazzoni, with the Porsche 917 of Jo Siffert and Derek Bell a further three laps down in third.","Motor Racing is a dangerous game and there had been some fatalities at Brands including the deaths of George Crossman, Tony Flory and Stuart Duncan in the mid-60s.","But in October 1971, the season drew to its close with the death of a major driver.","Jo Siffert died in an accident in the Rothmans World Championship Victory Race.","This non-championship event for Formula One and Formula 5000 cars was arranged to mark Jackie Stewart and Ken Tyrrell's joint World Championships.","The race was 40 laps in length; 'Seppi' lost control of his BRM P160 on lap 15, hit the bank at Hawthorn Hill, the car was engulfed in flames and he was asphyxiated before he could be extricated.","The circuit came under a great deal of criticism, and it was agreed that a three-year programme of major safety modifications around the track would be commenced before the start of the 1972 season.","The 1972 season was a particularly busy one, with Formula One visiting twice for the Race of Champions on 19 March sponsored by Daily Mail and the John Player-sponsored British Grand Prix on 15 July (bearing the title European Grand Prix), while the BOAC 1000 was the British round of the World Championship of Makes.","On 16 April, what was to be the last BOAC 1000 resulted in a complete Italian benefit race with Ferrari and Alfa Romeo filling the first six places.","The 235-lap race was won by Mario Andretti and Jacky Ickx in a Ferrari 312PB, with the average race speed of 105.12mph, from Tim Schenken and Ronnie Peterson, a lap down in a similar car.","The first Alfa home completed the podium, was the 33TT3 of Rolf Stommelen and Peter Revson.","And so to July, 76-laps of the Grand Prix Circuit adds up to just a few hundred yards over 200 miles which Emerson Fittipaldi completed in 1hr 47:50.2secs (108.67mph), driving the John Player Special Lotus-Cosworth 72D, from Jackie Stewart (Tyrrell-Cosworth 003), Peter Revson in the Team Yardley McLaren-Cosworth M19A, Chris Amon in the Matra-Simca MS120C, Denny Hulme Team Yardley McLaren-Cosworth M19C, with Arturo Merzario taking the last point in the Ferrari 312B2.","The following year, 1973, was less hectic; the BOAC 1000 was cancelled when the date offered by the FIA was unsuitable, and the year had an unfortunate Race of Champions.","Peter Gethin driving a Formula 5000 Chevron-Chevrolet B24 beat the Formula One cars and James Hunt made his F1 debut in Hesketh Racing's March 731.","Before the start of that season, \u00a350,000 was spent upon a new grandstand adjoining the Grovewood Suite, while opening seating and new pits were built to comply with FIA requirements.","There were also improvements made between Westfields and Stirlings.","It rained again during the Race of Champions in 1974, and the more nimble Formula One cars showed their heels to the Formula 5000 contingent; the winner was Jacky Ickx driving a Lotus-Ford 72E.","The Grand Prix circus returned to Brands for a race on 20 July, and the RAC (who organised the race) came in for censure from the FIA for allowing the pit lane to be blocked during the race, thus preventing Niki Lauda from rejoining at the end to claim fifth place, which he was awarded on appeal.","The winner was Jody Scheckter in a Tyrrell-Cosworth 007 who covered the 199.75-mile race at an average pace of 115.73mph, from Emerson Fittipaldi (McLaren-Cosworth M23B), Jacky Ickx (Lotus-Cosworth 72E), Clay Regazzoni and Niki Lauda (Ferrari 312B3) with Carlos Reutemann (Brabham-Cosworth BT44) in sixth.","The BOAC 1000 had become the British Airways 1000 and was dominated by the works Matra-Simca MS670C which finish first and second; first home were the Jean-Pierres \u2013 Jarier and Beltoise \u2013 with Henri Pescarolo and G\u00e9rard Larrousse second.","Third, no less than 11 laps down, was the Gulf-Ford GR7 of Derek Bell and David Hobbs.","The winter of 1974\/5 was mild, which was fortunate, allowing both tracks to be resurfaced in their entirety and completed in time for the opening event of 1975.","Tom Pryce had made a name for himself at Brands, driving Formula Ford and Formula F100 cars.","He came to the British Airways\/Daily Mail Race of Champions on 16 March as a works driver for the UOP Shadow.","He drove the DN5; Pryce carved his way through the field, closing upon Jody Scheckter's Tyrrell-Cosworth when Scheckter's engine blew.","This was Pryce's first and sadly, only Formula One win - he died a little over two years later during the 1977 South African Grand Prix.","It was again Grand Prix year in 1976, and notwithstanding the money already spent, another \u00a3100,000 was expended on the track and safety work;

year turned into a Grand Prix one after all; following the cancellation of the proposed New York Grand Prix, John Webb lobbied FISA in company with the RAC MSA and was granted the opportunity to run

second Lotus in third.","In 1984, Brands become the first British circuit to hold Grands Prix in three consecutive years since the 1950s.","This was officially the year for Kent to host the British Grand Prix but it was fraught with politics as Tyrrell was adjudged by the sport's governing body to have infringed the rules at the Canadian Grand Prix and was excluded from the remainder of the season.","A court injunction ensured that the cars started their home race, but Stefan Bellof and Stefan Johansson qualified the cars on the back row of the grid, the former finishing 11th but

reason for this was that the international motorsports governing body at the time, FISA, had instituted a policy of long-term contracts with circuits.","Brands Hatch was perceived as a poorer facility, and it did have very little run-off and room to expand, something Silverstone as a former World War II airfield had in acres.","Silverstone and the BRDC had signed a seven-year contract with

Zandvoort before World War II: the first street race was held on 3 June 1939.","However, a permanent race track was not constructed until after the war, using communications roads built by the occupying German army.","Contrary to popular belief John Hugenholtz cannot be credited with the design of the Zandvoort track, although he was involved as the chairman of the Nederlandse Automobiel Ren Club (Dutch Auto Racing Club) before becoming the first track director in 1949.","Instead, it was 1927 Le Mans winner, S. C.

first to be run as a round of the World Championship, albeit to Formula Two regulations rather than Formula One regulations like all the European rounds of the championship that year; a similar situation also applied to the 1953.","There was no Dutch Grand Prix in 1954, 1956 or 1957, but 1955 saw the first true Formula One race as part of the Drivers' Championship.","The Dutch Grand Prix returned in 1958 and remained a permanent fixture on the F1 calendar (with the exception of 1972) until 1985, when it was held for the last time in the 20th century.","To solve a number of problems that had made it impossible to develop and upgrade the track, the most important one being noise pollution for the inhabitants of the part of Zandvoort closest to the track, the track management adopted and developed a plan to move the most southern part of the track away from the housing estate and rebuild a more compact track in the remaining former 'infield'.","In January 1987 this plan got the necessary 'green light' when it was formally approved by the Provincial Council of North Holland.","However, only a couple of months later a new problem arose: the company that commercially

Los Angeles County.","Both Temple and his ranch house played important local roles in the Mexican\u2013American War.","On an island in the San Pedro Bay, Mormon pioneers made an abortive attempt to establish a colony (as part of Brigham Young's plan to establish a continuous chain of settlements from the Pacific to Salt Lake).","Following the U.S. Conquest of California, Temple had his Rancho Los Cerritos deeded to him by the Public Land Commission.","In 1866, Temple sold Rancho Los Cerritos for $20,000 to the Northern California sheep-raising firm of Flint, Bixby & Company, which consisted of brothers Thomas and Benjamin Flint and their cousin Lewellyn Bixby.","Two years previous Flint, Bixby & Co had also purchased along with Northern California associate James Irvine, three ranchos which would later become the city that bears Irvine's name.","To manage Rancho Los Cerritos, the company selected Lewellyn's brother Jotham Bixby, the \"Father of Long Beach\".","Three years later, Bixby bought into the property and would later form the Bixby Land Company.","In the 1870s, as many as 30,000 sheep were kept at the ranch and sheared twice yearly to provide wool for trade.","In 1880, Bixby sold 4,000 acres (16km) of the Rancho Los Cerritos to William E. Willmore, who subdivided it in hopes of creating a farm community, Willmore City.","He failed and was bought out by a Los Angeles syndicate that called itself the \"Long Beach Land and Water Company\".","They changed the name of the community to Long Beach at that time.","The City of Long Beach was officially incorporated in 1897.","The town grew as a seaside resort with light agricultural uses.","The Pike was the most famous beachside amusement zone on the West Coast from 1902 until 1969; it offered bathers food, games and rides, such at the Sky Wheel dual Ferris wheel and Cyclone Racer roller coaster.","Gradually the oil industry, Navy shipyard and facilities and port became the mainstays of the city.","In the 1950s it was referred to as \"Iowa by the sea\", due to a large influx of people from that and other Midwestern states.","Huge picnics for migrants from each state were a popular annual event in Long Beach until the 1960s.","Another Bixby cousin, John W. Bixby, was influential in the city.","After first working for his cousins at Los Cerritos, J.W.","Bixby leased land at Rancho Los Alamitos.","He put together a group: banker I.W.","Hellman, Lewellyn and Jotham Bixby, and him, to purchase the rancho.","In addition to bringing innovative farming methods to the Alamitos (which under Abel Stearns in the late 1850s and early 1860s was once the largest cattle ranch in the US), J.W.","Bixby began the development of the oceanfront property near the city's picturesque bluffs.","Under the name Alamitos Land Company, J.W.","Bixby named the streets and laid out the parks of his new city.","This area would include Belmont Heights, Belmont Shore and Naples; it soon became a thriving community of its own.","J.W.","Bixby died in 1888 of apparent appendicitis.","The Rancho Los Alamitos property was split up, with Hellman getting the southern third, Jotham and Lewellyn, the northern third, and J.W.","Bixby's widow and heirs keeping the central third.","The Alamitos townsite was kept as a separate entity, but at first, it was primarily run by Lewellyn and Jotham Bixby, although I.W, Hellman (who had the largest single share) had a significant veto power, an influence made even stronger as the J.W.","Bixby heirs began to side with Hellman more and more.","When Jotham Bixby died in 1916, the remaining 3,500 acres (14km) of Rancho Los Cerritos was subdivided into the neighborhoods of Bixby Knolls, California Heights, Los Cerritos, North Long Beach and part of the city of Signal Hill.","Oil was discovered in 1921 on Signal Hill, which split off as a separately incorporated city shortly afterward.","The discovery of the Long Beach Oil Field, brought in by the gusher at the Alamitos oil well #1, made Long Beach a major oil producer; in the 1920s the field was the most productive in the world.","In 1932, the even larger Wilmington Oil Field, fourth-largest in the United States, and which is mostly in Long Beach, was developed, contributing to the city's fame in the 1930s as an oil town.","The M6.4 1933 Long Beach earthquake caused significant damage to the city and surrounding areas, killing a total of 120 people.","Most of the damage occurred in unreinforced masonry buildings, especially schools.","Pacific Bible Seminary (now known as Hope International University) was forced to move classes out of First Christian Church of Long Beach and into a small local home due to damage.","The Ford Motor Company built a factory called Long Beach Assembly at the then address in 1929 as \"700 Henry Ford Avenue, Long Beach\" where the factory began building the Ford Model A.","Production of Ford vehicles continued after the war until 1960 when the plant was closed due to a fire, and January 1991 when the factory was demolished partially due to air quality remediation efforts.","Ford had earlier opened a Factory in Los Angeles at the location of 12th Street and Olive, with a later factory built at East Seventh Street and Santa Fe Avenue after 1914.","Come 1938, the creation of Housing Authorities for both the City and County of Los Angeles were complete \u2014 and North Long Beach was to be home to the County Authority's first order of business: the Carmelitos Housing Project, Southern California's first affordable housing complex.","The city was part of the Battle of Los Angeles during World War II when observers for the United States Army Air Forces reported shells being fired from the sea.","Anti-aircraft batteries fired into the night sky, although no planes were ever sighted.","Before the war, Long Beach had a sizable Japanese-American population, who worked in the fish canneries on Terminal Island and owned small truck (produce) farms in the area.","Due to exaggerated fears on the coast and racial prejudice, state officials persuaded the national government to remove Japanese nationals and Japanese Americans for internment in 1942 to inland facilities.","Most did not return to the city after their release from the camps.","Due to this and other factors, Japanese Americans now make up less than 1% of the population of Long Beach, but the Japanese Community Center and a Japanese Buddhist Church survive.","The Japanese-American Cultural Center is over the Gerald Desmond Bridge and the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro.","Douglas Aircraft Company's largest facility was its Long Beach plant, totaling 1,422,350 sq.","ft.","The first plane rolled out the door on December 23, 1941.","The plant produced C-47 Skytrain transports, B-17 Flying Fortress bombers, and A-20 Havoc attack bombers simultaneously.","Douglas merged with the McDonnell Aircraft Company in 1967 where the Douglas DC-8 and the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 were built.","In 1997 McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing, which made C-17 Globemaster transport planes in Long Beach until the close of the manufacturing facility in 2015.","Long Beach is about 20 miles (32km) south of downtown Los Angeles.","According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 51.437 square miles (133.2km), of which 50.293 square miles (130.3km) is land and 1.144 square miles (2.96km) (2.22%) is water.","Long Beach completely surrounds the city of Signal Hill.","Long Beach is composed of many different neighborhoods.","Some neighborhoods are named after thoroughfares, while others are named for nearby parks, schools, or city features.","Long Beach has a climate that can either be described as a hot semi-arid climate or a hot-summer Mediterranean climate.","In general, the city features hot summers and mild to warm winters with occasional rainfall.","Days in Long Beach are mostly sunny, as in Southern California in general.","Temperatures recorded at the weather station at the Long Beach Airport, 4.0 miles (6.4km) inland from the ocean, range more greatly than those along the immediate coast.","During the summer months, low clouds and fog occur frequently, developing overnight and blanketing the area on many mornings.","This fog usually clears by the afternoon, and a westerly sea breeze often develops, keeping temperatures mild.","Heat and high humidity can sometimes coincide in summer, which may cause discomfort due to the heat index.","Long Beach's location directly east of the Palos Verdes Peninsula, paired with its south facing coastline, results in the city sometimes experiencing different weather patterns than the Los Angeles metropolitan area coastal communities to the northwest and southeast of Long Beach, which largely have west facing coastlines.","The 1200ft Palos Verdes hills block west to east airflow and a significant amount of the coastal moisture that marks other coastal cities, such as Manhattan Beach, Santa Monica, and Newport Beach.","As in most locations in Southern California, most rainfall in Long Beach occurs during the winter months.","Storms can bring heavy rainfall.","Long Beach suffers from some of the worst air pollution in the entire United States.","Most of the city is in proximity to the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, and the prevailing westerly-to-west-south-westerly winds bring a large portion of the twin ports' air pollution directly into Long Beach before dispersing it northward then eastward.","Heavy pollution sources at the ports include the ships themselves, which burn high-sulfur, high-soot-producing bunker fuel to maintain internal electrical power while docked, as well as heavy diesel pollution from drayage trucks at the ports, and short-haul tractor-trailer trucks ferrying cargo from the ports to inland warehousing, rail yards, and shipping centers.","Long-term average levels of toxic air pollutants (and the corresponding carcinogenic risk they create) can be two to three times higher in and around Long Beach, and in downwind areas to the east, than in other parts of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, such as the Westside, San Fernando Valley, or San Gabriel Valley.","While overall regional pollution in the Los Angeles metropolitan area has declined in the last decade, pollution levels remain dangerously high in much of Long Beach due to the port pollution, with diesel exhaust from ships, trains, and trucks as the largest sources.","Additionally, Long Beach is directly downwind of several of the South Bay oil refineries.","Any refinery process or chemical upset that results in the atmospheric release of refinery by-products (commonly sulfur dioxide) will usually impact air quality in Long Beach due to the west-south-westerly prevailing wind.","Similarly, the water quality in the Long Beach portion of San Pedro Bay, which is enclosed by the Federal Breakwater, commonly ranks among the poorest on the entire West Coast during rainy periods.","Long Beach beaches average a D or F grade on beach water quality during rainy periods in the Beach Report Card published by Heal the Bay.","However, during dry periods the water may have an A or B rating in the same reports.","The Los Angeles River discharges directly into the Long Beach side of San Pedro Bay, meaning a large portion of all the urban runoff from the entire Los Angeles metropolitan area pours directly into the harbor water.","This runoff contains most of the debris, garbage, chemical pollutants, and biological pathogens washed into storm drains in every upstream city each time it rains.","Because the breakwater prevents tidal flushing and wave action, these pollutants build up in the harbor.","The water enclosed by the breakwater, along most of the city's beaches, can be subject to red tides due to this stagnation as well.","Because of these factors, the water in Long Beach is unsafe for swimming on a few days or weeks each year.","The area that is now Long Beach historically included several ecological communities, with coastal scrub dominating.","A handful of the native plants of the region can still be found in the city.","These include California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum), California sagebrush (Artemisia californica), and California poppy (Eschscholzia californica).","Some stands of coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia) still remain in the El Dorado Nature Center.","California fan palm (Washingtonia filifera), a plant that is native further inland, was introduced to the city as a garden ornamental and is now naturalized.","Some indigenous species of birds, mammals, and other wildlife have adapted to development.","Since the arrival of Europeans, many alien species have become naturalized in the area.","Introduced plants include yellow mustard, eucalyptus, wild radish, and tumbleweed.","Such plants now far outnumber the indigenous plants and spread rapidly in the city's vacant lots and oil fields.","The city and its residents have initiatives underway to preserve and reclaim part of its ecological heritage.","The RiverLink project has begun to revegetate the Long Beach stretch of the Los Angeles River with indigenous plants.","Part of the remaining Pacific Electric right-of-way was cleared of nonnatives, planted with indigenous plants, and made accessible with foot and bike paths.","This community open space is now known as The Long Beach Greenbelt and is the focus of continuing efforts in restoration and community education.","The El Dorado Nature Center has changed its original \"hands-off\" approach and has begun to actively introduce indigenous species.","The Los Cerritos Wetlands Study Group, state government agencies, and grassroots groups are collaborating on a plan to preserve Long Beach's last remaining wetlands.","Long Beach is the first city in California to join the 'EcoZone' Program, intended to measurably improve environmental conditions through public-private partnerships.","Such projects seek to reduce pollution, restore native habitat, and provide green areas for the city's residents to enjoy.","Other places in Long Beach to see natural areas include Bluff Park (coastal bluffs), the Golden Shore Marine Biological Reserve, the Jack Dunster Marine Reserve, Shoreline Park, and DeForest Park.","Long Beach led Southern California in parks access, size and spending, ranking 16th among a survey of 75 large U.S. cities, with Los Angeles and Anaheim tied for 51st and Santa Ana 69th, according to a study released by a national conservation group.","The 2010 United States Census reported that Long Beach had a population of 462,257.","The population density was 9,191.3

Las Vegas has one of the highest divorce rates.","The city's high divorce rate is not wholly due to Las Vegans themselves getting divorced.","Since divorce is easier in Nevada than in most other states, many people come from across the country for the easier process.","Similarly, Nevada marriages are notoriously easy to get.","Las Vegas has one of the highest marriage rates of U.S. cities, with many licenses issued to people from outside the area (see Las Vegas weddings).","The primary drivers of the Las Vegas economy are tourism, gaming, and conventions, which in turn feed the retail

are located on Fremont Street, with The STRAT Hotel, Casino & Skypod as one of the few exceptions.","Fremont East, adjacent to the Fremont Street Experience, was granted variances to allow bars to be

unincorporated communities of Paradise and Winchester in Clark County.","Some of the largest casinos and buildings are located there.","When The Mirage opened in 1989, it started a trend of major resort development on the Las Vegas Strip outside of the city.","This resulted in a drop in tourism in the downtown area, but many recent projects have increased the number of visitors to downtown.","An effort has been made by city officials to diversify the economy by attracting health-related, high-tech and other commercial interests.","No state tax for individuals or corporations, as well as a lack of other forms of business-related taxes, have aided the success of these efforts.","The Fremont Street Experience was built in an effort to draw tourists back to the area and has been popular since its startup in 1995.","The city purchased 61 acres (25ha) of property from the Union Pacific Railroad in 1995 with the goal of creating a better draw for more people to the downtown

Suzuka), the 3.850km (2.392mi) circuit was built by Alessandro Rocci in 1967 on arid scrub land.","It has a short main straight and most of the course consisted of tight, twisty corners so overtaking was extremely difficult.","An example of this came when Gilles Villeneuve successfully defended his lead throughout the 1981 Spanish Grand Prix, despite a tail of four potentially faster cars.","Villeneuve's turbocharged Ferrari 126CK, while powerful and fast on the straight, did not have as efficient ground effect aerodynamics as his pursuers - Jacques Laffite (V12 Ligier-Matra), John Watson (McLaren-Ford), Carlos Reutemann (Williams-Ford), and Elio de Angelis (Lotus-Ford) and was slower through the turns.","This victory was to be the last one of Villeneuve's career.","Jarama hosted its last Formula One race in 1981 when it was deemed too narrow for modern racing.","It still holds sports car, touring car and motorcycle races.","The circuit was lengthened in 1991, and then upgraded in 2015.","In 1987, Jarama hosted Round 2 of the inaugural World Touring Car Championship for Group A cars, the 1987 Jarama 4 Hours.","The race was won by Roberto Ravaglia and Emanuele Pirro driving a Schnitzer Motorsport BMW M3.","Pole position for the race had been taken by triple Le Mans 24 Hour winner Klaus Ludwig in a Ford Sierra RS Cosworth turbo with a time of 1:31.434, while the fastest lap was by England's Andy Rouse (also in a Sierra Cosworth) with a time of 1:33.710."]},{"category":"Circuit","circuitId":46,"name":"Watkins Glen","location":"New York

the town of Dix just southwest of the village of Watkins Glen, New York, at the southern tip of Seneca Lake.","It was long known around the world as the home of the Formula One United States Grand Prix, which it hosted for twenty consecutive years (1961\u20131980).","Still, the site has also been home to road racing of nearly every class, including the World Sportscar Championship, Trans-Am, Can-Am, NASCAR Cup Series, the International Motor Sports Association and the IndyCar Series.","The facility is currently owned by NASCAR.","The course was opened in 1956 to host auto races previously held on public roads in and around the village.","The circuit's current layout has more or less been the same since 1971, with minor modifications after the fatal crashes of Fran\u00e7ois Cevert in 1973 and J.D.","McDuffie in 1991.","The circuit is a Mecca of North American road racing and is a popular venue among fans and drivers.","The site has also hosted music concerts: the 1973 Summer Jam, featuring The Allman Brothers Band, the Grateful Dead and The Band and attended by 600,000 fans; and two Phish festivals: Super Ball IX in 2011 and Magnaball in 2015.","The Watkins Glen International racecourse has undergone several changes over the years, with five general layouts widely recognized over its history.","Currently, two distinct layouts are used: the \"Boot\" layout (long course) and the \"NASCAR\" layout (short course).","The first races in Watkins Glen were organized by Cameron Argetsinger, whose family had a summer home in the area.","With local Chamber of Commerce approval and SCCA sanction, the first Watkins Glen Grand Prix took place in 1948 on a 6.6-mile (10.6km) course over local public roads.","For the first few years, the races passed through the heart of the town with spectators lining the sidewalks.","However, after a car driven by Fred Wacker left the road in the 1952 race, killing seven-year-old Frank Fazzari and injuring several others, the race was moved to a new location on a wooded hilltop southwest of town.","The original 6.6-mile (10.6km) course is listed in the New York State Register and National Register of Historic Places as the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Course, 1948\u20131952.","The second layout 4.6-mile (7.4km) began use in 1953 and also used existing roads.","The Watkins Glen Grand Prix Corporation was formed to manage spectators, parking, and concessions.","This arrangement lasted three years.","The first permanent course was constructed on 550 acres, overlapping part of the previous street course.","It was designed by Bill Milliken and engineering professors from Cornell University.","The layout measured 2.350-mile (3.782km).","This course was used from 1956 to 1970.","In 1968 the race was extended to six hours.","The circuit underwent a major overhaul for the 1971 season.","The \"Big Bend\" and the turns leading up to it were eliminated and replaced with a new pit straight.","The pits and start\/finish line were moved to this new straightaway.","\"The 90\" now became Turn 1 instead of Turn 8.","When the 1971 Six Hours of Watkins Glen arrived in July 1971, the overall circuit renovations were still unfinished.","The short course had been finished, but the Boot segments were not complete, nor was the new pit area.","The 1971 Six Hours race was run on the short course layout.","That layout colloquially became known as the 1971 Six Hours Course.","In addition, for 1971 only, the cars used the original start\/finish line and the old pits.","When NASCAR returned to the track in 1986, it used the short course layout.","IMSA initially used the \"Boot\", but eventually, that series also began using the shorter 1971 layout.","The short course was slightly lengthened in 1992 (see \"Inner Loop\" below).","The most significant change to the track, a new segment known as \"The Boot\", was finished in time for the Formula One race in 1971.","The start-finish line was moved to the new pit straight as planned.","At the end of the backstretch, after the Loop-Chute, cars swept left into a new four-turn complex that departed from the old layout, curling left-hand downhill through the woods.","The track followed the edge of the hillside to two uphill right-hand turns, over an exciting blind crest into a right-hand turn, down and up into a left-hand turn rejoining the old track.","The new layout measured 3.377 miles (5.435km).","With its intrinsic link to the Formula One race, it became known colloquially as the Grand Prix Circuit.","For 1972, the Six Hours sportscar race also began using the full \"Boot\" layout.","By that time, nearly all facility improvements were completed.","The pits and start\/finish line were permanently moved to the new pit straight.","In 1973, French driver Fran\u00e7ois Cevert, a previous winner at the Glen, died in a crash during practice at the 1973 United States Grand Prix.","This led course officials in 1975 to add a fast right-left chicane to slow speeds in the turn 3-4 Esses section.","Dubbed the \"Scheckter Chicane\", it was eliminated in 1985.","In the early 1990s, the IMSA sports cars bypassed the \"Boot\" in favor of the short course.","NASCAR events have never used the Boot layout.","The \"Long\/Boot\" course was slightly lengthened in 1992 (see \"Inner Loop\" below).","In the mid-2000s, the Boot segment, which had seen little use in many years, was repaved and upgraded.","When the IndyCar Series returned to Watkins Glen starting in 2005, they used the Boot segment.","The entire course was repaved in 2015.","There has been a renewed interest and appreciation of the full Grand Prix Course layout in recent years.","Consideration had even been made for NASCAR to start using the Boot.","The most recent significant change to the course was made in 1992, after several serious crashes at the \"Loop\" at the end of the backstretch.","During the 1989 Budweiser at the Glen, Geoff Bodine blew a tire at the end of the backstretch.","He broke into a hard spin and sailed straight off the track, crashing head-on into the barrier.","In 1991, during the IMSA Camel Continental VIII, Tommy Kendall's Intrepid RM-1 prototype crashed in the Loop, severely injuring his legs.","Seven weeks later, NASCAR Winston Cup driver J. D. McDuffie died in an accident at the same site during the 1991 Budweiser at The Glen.","Before the 1992 season, track officials constructed a bus stop chicane along the back straight just before the Loop.","Dubbed the \"Inner Loop\", it led into what was now being called the \"Outer Loop.\"","This addition slightly increased the lap distance for both layouts.","Along with the annual SCCA race, the track hosted its first professional race (NASCAR Grand National Division) in 1957.","It hosted its first international event with the Formula Libre races from 1958 to 1960.","Among the drivers participating were Jack Brabham, Stirling Moss, Phil Hill, and Dan Gurney.","After two editions of the Formula One United States Grand Prix that were deemed less than successful (Sebring in 1959, and Riverside in 1960), promoters were looking for a new venue to become the permanent home for the United States Grand Prix.","In 1961, just six weeks before the scheduled date for another Formula Libre race that fall, Argetsinger was tapped to prepare Watkins Glen for the final round of the Formula One World Championship.","While many of the necessary preparations had already been made, new pits were constructed to satisfy international standards of pit boxes with overhead cover.","Seven American drivers participated, and the 1961 United States Grand Prix was won by British driver Innes Ireland in a Lotus-Climax.","American Dan Gurney driving a Porsche 718 placed second.","Having already won both Driver's and Constructor's World Championships and still mourning the death of Wolfgang von Trips at the 1961 Italian Grand Prix, Ferrari decided not to compete in the United States GP.","Ferrari's decision not to travel to the United States for the season's final round deprived Hill of participating in his home race as the newly crowned World Champion, and Hill appeared only as the event's Grand Marshal.","The United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen quickly became an autumnal tradition as huge crowds of knowledgeable racing fans flocked to Upstate New York each year amid the region's spectacular autumn leaf color.","The race was also among the most popular on the global Grand Prix calendar with the teams and drivers because its starting and prize money often exceeded those of the other races combined.","The race received the Grand Prix Drivers' Association award for the best organized and best staged GP of the season in 1965, 1970, and 1972.","One fixture of the USGP at Watkins Glen was the starter for the races, Richard Norman \"Tex\" Hopkins.","Hopkins was the most recognizable starter in Grand Prix racing, wearing a lavender suit, clenching a big cigar in his mouth, and giving the job everything he had.","Once the cars had taken their places, Hopkins strode across the front of the grid with his back to the field, turned, and jumped into the air while waving the national flag to start the race.","He would similarly meet the winner at the finish, this time waving the checkered flag as the car crossed the line.","Before the 1971 race, the course underwent its most significant changes of the Grand Prix era, as it was extended from 2.35 miles (3.78km) to 3.377 miles (5.435km) by the addition of four corners in a new section called the 'Boot' or 'Anvil'.","The new layout departed from the old course near the south end into a curling downhill left-hand turn through the woods.","The track followed the edge of the hillside to two consecutive right-hand turns, over an exciting blind crest to a left-hand turn, and back onto the old track.","In addition, the circuit was widened and resurfaced.","The pits and start-finish line were moved back before the northwest right-angle corner known as \"The 90\".","In 1975, a fast right-left chicane was added to slow speeds through the series of corners in the Esses section.","Despite the improvements, the circuit was unsafe for the increasingly faster and stiffer ground effect cars of the late 1970s.","A few horrendous, sometimes fatal accidents occurred (such as those that claimed the lives of Helmut Koinigg and Fran\u00e7ois Cevert).","Increasingly rowdy segments of the crowd began to tarnish its image as well.","Finally, in May 1981, several months after Alan Jones had won the 1980 race for Williams, the International Auto Sports Federation removed the race from its schedule because the track had failed to pay its $800,000 debt to the teams.","The Glen hosted a variety of other events throughout the Grand Prix years: from Can-Am, Trans-Am, IROC, and Endurance Sports car racing, to Formula 5000 and the CART series, these races strengthened the circuit's reputation as the premier road racing facility in the United States.","From 1968 through 1981, the \"Six Hours at The Glen\" endurance race featured top drivers such as Mario Andretti, Jacky Ickx, Pedro Rodr\u00edguez, and Derek Bell.","Different races were sometimes featured together on the same weekend (e.g., Six Hours and Can-Am) and drew sizable crowds.","However, without a Formula One race, the circuit struggled to survive.","It finally declared bankruptcy and closed in 1981.","The track was not well maintained for two years and hosted only a few SCCA meets without spectators.","In 1983, Corning Enterprises, a subsidiary of nearby Corning, partnered with International Speedway Corporation to purchase the track and rename it Watkins Glen International.","In 1986, the top NASCAR series returned to Watkins Glen after a long layoff, holding one of only three road races on its schedule (two beginning in 1988), using the 1971 Six Hours course, raced when the new section off the Loop-Chute was not finished in time.","As the cars come off the Loop-Chute, instead of making the downhill left into Turn 6, the cars shot straight through the straight and headed toward Turn 10, as was the case from 1961 until 1970.","NASCAR Busch Series (now called Xfinity Series) action would arrive in 1991 with a 150-mile (240km) race on the weekend of the Camel Continental, won by Terry Labonte, who would be a master of the circuit during its Busch Series races, winning the inaugural race, and winning three consecutive races from 1995 until 1997.","The 1995 race would be the first conducted as a 200-mile (320km) race, and became the first Busch Series race to be televised on broadcast network television, as CBS broadcast the race live until TNN took over in 1997.","Only twice\u20141998 and 1999\u2014did a Busch Series regular driver win the race.","The first seven races were won by Winston Cup Series regular drivers, sometimes referred to as \"Buschwhackers\", during their off-week.","In 1998, the race went against the Cup race in Sonoma, California, eliminating the idea, and stayed that way until 2000.","In 2001, the race was run the day after the first Saturday in July.","However, the race was eliminated from the schedule after the 2001 season, only to return in 2005 as an undercard to the Nextel Cup race.","A pair of incidents in 1991 resulted in a massive overhaul of the circuit's safety.","During the IMSA Camel Continental VIII, Tommy Kendall's prototype crashed in Turn 5, severely injuring his legs.","Seven weeks later, NASCAR Cup Series driver J. D. McDuffie died in an accident at the same site in the 1991 Budweiser at the Glen.","Track officials added a bus stop chicane to the back straight in Spring 1992.","In 1996, the Glen Continental reverted to a six-hour format, again called the Six Hours at the Glen with the IMSA format, and stayed there until a split in American sports car racing.","In 1998, the race became an event sanctioned by the Sports Car Club of America under their United States Road Racing Championship.","In 1999, the FIA GT series staged a 500km race of three hours with some USRRC entrants after USRRC canceled the last two rounds of their season before their six-hour event at the track.","The following year, the six-hour race returned once again with the newly founded Grand American Road Racing Association (Grand-Am) sanctioning the event.","The event is now sanctioned by IMSA with the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship.","The six-hour race is now the third part of the four-part North American Endurance Cup series.","In 1997, International Speedway Corporation became the sole owner of the course, as Corning Enterprises believed they had completed their intended goals to rebuild the race track and increase tourism in the southern Finger Lakes region of New York State.","The circuit annually hosts one of the nation's premier vintage events, the Zippo U.S. Vintage Grand Prix.","When the fiftieth anniversary of road racing in Watkins Glen was celebrated during the 1998 racing season, this event was the climax, returning many original cars and drivers to the original 6.6-mile (10.6km) street circuit through the village during the Grand Prix Festival Race Reenactment.","After a 25-year layoff, major-league open-wheel racing returned to the track as one of three road courses on the 2005 Indy Racing League schedule.","In preparation, the circuit was overhauled again.","Grandstands from Pennsylvania's Nazareth Speedway, which had closed, were installed, the gravel in The 90 was removed and replaced with a paved runoff area, and curbing was cut down for the Indy Racing League event.","Previously, the high curbing in the chicane had become a place where Cup Series cars would bounce high off the curbing, creating an ideal opportunity for cars to lose control and to slow cars.","Other areas of the track received improvements: the exits of turn 2 (the bottom of the esses), the chicane, turn 6 (the entrance to the boot), turn 9, and turn 11 all had additional runoff areas created and safety barrier upgrades.","The carousel runoff was paved, and turn 1 (the 90), and the esses were paved in the winter of 2006\u201307.","Augmenting what was already in place along the front stretch, additional high safety fences were installed on the overpasses crossing the service roads at the top of the esses and just out of the boot immediately after the exit of turn 9.","Another overhaul for 2006 made fundamental changes to the circuit for the first time since 1992.","Officials installed a new control tower, which includes booths for the officials, timing and scoring, television and radio (the new position allows broadcasters to see more action from Turn 10 through the foot of the Esses), and the public address announcer on top of the new front stretch grandstand, moving the start-finish line farther ahead of the bridge, as the start-finish line is moved 380 feet (120m) farther toward The 90 in order to accommodate the new timing and scoring post.","The new start-finish line also meant the starting lights used for club races were moved farther ahead, creating more action off Turn 11 as tactics changed with the later finish line, where slingshot moves could become paramount to the finish.","A new media center was constructed to replace the former building, which also had been the control tower with the 1971 improvements.","The aging structure had been the bane of many professional media members during those years with many uncomplimentary things published and broadcast about its inadequacies, especially the lack of insulation, air conditioning, few (if any) amenities that other facilities had, which resulted in race control moving to the new control tower at the start-finish line in 2006.","Plans were made to move the new media center back to allow an entire 43-car NASCAR grid.","Other changes to the infrastructure included the purchase of adjoining property.","Most of Bronson Hill Road was incorporated as a service road to the facility.","A new section of Bronson Hill leading up from NY 414 was built as the main ingress road to the facility, bending south at Gate 6 and continuing to County Road 16, just south of the credentials and sheriff's office buildings.","Track safety also is constantly changing, and constant training is needed.","Race Services Inc. provides the track with volunteers to work Fire-Rescue, Medical, Grid personnel, and Corner workers to help keep drivers and spectators safe.","The Argetsinger family is an advisor to the circuit.","The track named the trophy for the inaugural Watkins Glen Indy Grand Prix presented by Argent in honor of the late patriarch, Cameron.","On Tuesday, March 6, 2007, just before 9pm, a fire destroyed the recently remodeled Glen Club situated on top of the esses.","Originally called the Onyx Club (named for the sponsor, Onyx Cologne), the Glen Club was used primarily as an upscale venue for race fans.","After being recently remodeled, it was advertised as a social venue for locals for weddings, business meetings, etc.","No cause could be determined, and the building was a total loss.","The loss included irreplaceable, unique original motorsport artwork donated to the facility by several artists and other racing memorabilia.","Glen officials were quoted in local media stories as being adamant that the loss of the Glen Club would not affect the 2007 racing schedule.","For 2007, Watkins Glen International again improved the facility, specifically the track surface.","All of turns 1 (the \"90\"), 5 (the \"Loop-Chute\") and 6 (entry turn into the \"Boot\") were repaved.","A temporary \"Glen Club\" replaced the permanent structure destroyed by fire at the races in 2007, which was replaced with another permanent building.","New sponsors for both the INDY and NASCAR weekends were signed to multi-year deals.","Camping World became the sponsor of the \"Camping World Grand Prix\" INDY weekend at the Glen through 2010.","The NASCAR weekend at the Glen received a double shot\u2014Zippo Manufacturing announced a three-year extension of the Busch-Nationwide Series race, the \"Zippo 200\".","The NASCAR Cup Series race became known as \"The Heluva Good!","Sour Cream dips at the Glen\".","Additionally, Brad Penn lubricants of Pennsylvania (former Kendall Oil refinery) was announced as the sponsor of the annual vintage sports car weekend for 2007 and 2008.","IndyCar took a six-year hiatus from the facility when the series pulled out of the Glen after 2010 due to a dispute with track owner ISC.","In June 2011, Tony Stewart and Lewis Hamilton participated in the \"Mobil 1 Seat Swap\".","Stewart drove his No.","14 Mobil 1 Chevy for four laps around the circuit while Hamilton drove the MP4-23, Vodafone McLaren Mercedes's entry in the 2008 Formula One season.","After some time, both drivers swapped cars and drove more laps around the circuit.","The event was open to the public, and it was hoped that it would renew interest in the track.","Before this event, the curbs on some of the turns were changed, the white rumble strips being replaced by the more common, red-white designs seen on most road courses around the world.","In July 2011, WGI hosted a Phish concert.","This is the first concert that WGI has held since the Summer Jam.","In October 2012, the track suffered damage from Hurricane Sandy, with damage reported to be up to $50,000.","Prior to the 2014 season, the track cleaned out a storage barn on track property when the original Dunlop Bridge was found.","The bridge was initially used as a VIP area for Dunlop until being moved for use as the starters stand years later.","It was taken down and replaced by a new starters stand during renovations in 2006.","The bridge was put back up at the exit to the 90 near the original location where it once stood near the original start\/finish line for the track and is now once again used for VIP use by companies on race weekends, with the company sponsoring the bridge.","After the 2014 racing season, it was announced that the 2015 racing season would conclude with the NASCAR weekend in early August.","This was to allow for a complete repaving of the track.","The repave involved removing the entire racing surface.","In some places, the track was taken down to the dirt roadbed.","This was funded not only by International Speedway Corporation but with a grant from New York State.","In March 2015, due to their previous concert's success, Phish said they would do another concert at WGI in late August.","In August 2015, with repaving already having taken place in the Boot, NASCAR announced that they are considering running the complete Grand Prix Course.","2016 would see the return of IndyCar racing to Watkins Glen, with the track being added to the schedule following the collapse of plans for a street race in Boston.","It was held over the Labor Day weekend and used the full layout: ICS officials were also negotiating with WGI to race there permanently.","No races were held in 2020 because of the COVID-19

making it one of the longest circuits in the world.","The capacity of the race stadium, where the short Bugatti Circuit is situated, is 100,000.","The Mus\u00e9e des 24 Heures du Mans is a motorsport museum located at the main entrance of the venue.","Up to 85% of the lap time is spent on full throttle, putting immense stress on engine and drivetrain components.","Additionally, the times spent reaching maximum speed also mean tremendous wear on the brakes and suspension as cars must slow from over 322km\/h (200mph) to around 100km\/h (60mph) for the sharp corner at the village of Mulsanne.","The road racing track, which was a triangle from Le Mans down south to Mulsanne, northwest to Arnage, and back north to Le Mans, has undergone many modifications over the years, with CIRCUIT N\u00b015 being in use since 2018.","Even with the modifications put in place over the years, the Sarthe circuit is still known for being very fast, with prototype cars achieving average lap speeds in excess of 240km\/h (150mph).","In the 1920s, the cars drove from the present pits on Rue de Laign\u00e9 straight into the city, and after a sharp right-hand corner near the river Huisne Pontlieue bridge (a hairpin permanently removed from the circuit in 1929), before exiting the city again on the rather straight section now named Avenue Georges Durand after the race's founder.","Then 17.261 kilometres (10.725mi) long and unpaved, a bypass within the city shortened the track in 1929, but the city was only bypassed completely in 1932, when the section from the pits via the Dunlop Bridge and the Esses to Tertre Rouge was added.","This classic configuration was 13.492 kilometres (8.384mi) long and remained almost unaltered even after the 1955 tragedy.","Its frighteningly narrow pit straight was further narrowed to make room for the pits and was part of the road itself, without the road becoming wider around the pits, and no separation.","The pit straight then was about 12 feet (3.7m) wide, further widened in 1956 after the tragedy, but the race track and pits were not separated for another 15 years.","Car speeds increased dramatically in the 1960s, pushing the limits of  the \"classic circuit\" and sparking criticism of the track as being unsafe after several trials related fatalities occurred.","In 1965, a smaller, but permanent, Bugatti Circuit was added which shares the pit lane facilities and the first corner (including the famous Dunlop bridge) with the full \"Le Mans\" circuit.","For the 1968 race, the Ford chicane was added before the pits to slow down the cars.","The circuit was fitted with Armco for the 1969 race.","The \"Maison Blanche\" kink was particularly harrowing, claiming many cars over the years (including three Ferrari 512 variants) and several lives, including the legendary John Woolfe in 1969 behind the wheel of a 917 Porsche .","The circuit has been modified ten more times \u2014 1971, a year when prototypes were averaging over 240km\/h (150mph), was the last year the classic circuit was used.","That year, Armco was added to the pit straight to separate the track from the pits.","In 1972, the race track was considerably revamped, at a cost of 300 million francs, with modification of the pit area and the first and final straights, the addition of the quick Porsche curves bypassing \"Maison Blanche\", the signalling area was moved to the exit of the slow Mulsanne corner, and the track was resurfaced.","In 1979, due to the construction of a new public road, the profile of \"Tertre Rouge\" had to be changed.","This redesign led to a faster double-apex corner and saw the removal of the second Dunlop Bridge.","In 1986, construction of a new roundabout at the Mulsanne corner demanded the addition a new portion of track in order to avoid the roundabout.","This created a right hand kink prior to Mulsanne corner.","In 1987, a chicane was added to the very fast Dunlop curve, where cars would go under the Dunlop bridge at 180mph (290km\/h).","Now they would be slowed to 110mph (180km\/h).","Le Mans was most famous for its 6km (3.7mi) long straight, called Ligne Droite des Hunaudi\u00e8res, a part of the route d\u00e9partementale (for the Sarthe d\u00e9partement) D338 (formerly Route Nationale N138).","As the Hunaudi\u00e8res leads to the village of Mulsanne, it is often called the Mulsanne Straight in English, even though the proper Route du Mulsanne is the one from or to Arnage.","After exiting the Tertre Rouge corner, cars spent almost half of the lap at full throttle, before braking for Mulsanne Corner.","The Porsche 917 long tail, used from 1969 to 1971, had reached 362km\/h (225mph).","After engine size was limited, the top speed dropped until powerful turbo engines were allowed, like in the 1978 Porsche 935, which was clocked at 367km\/h (228mph).","Speeds on the straight by the Group C prototypes reached over 400km\/h (250mph) during the late 1980s.","At the beginning of the 1988 24 Hours of Le Mans race, Roger Dorchy driving for Welter Racing in a \"Project 400\" car, which sacrificed reliability for speed, was clocked by radar travelling at 407 kilometres per hour (253mph).","Jean-Louis Lafosse and Jo Gartner would ultimately suffer from fatal high speed accidents in 1981 and 1986, respectively, leading to concerns with the growing speeds on the 3.7 mile straight.","As the combination of high speed and high downforce caused tyre and engine failures, two roughly equally spaced chicanes were consequently added to the Mulsanne Straight before the 1990 race to limit the maximum achievable speed.","The chicanes were also added because the FIA decreed it would no longer sanction a circuit which had a straight longer than 2 kilometres (1.2mi)., which is roughly the length of the D\u00f6ttinger H\u00f6he straight at the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife.","The fastest qualifying lap average speed though only dropped from 249.826 to 243.329km\/h (155.235 to 151.198mph) in 1992.","In 1994, the Dunlop chicane was tightened.","In 2002, the run to the Esses was reconfigured in the wake of renovations to the Bugatti Circuit.","The Le Mans circuit was changed between the Dunlop Bridge and Esses, with the straight now becoming a set of fast sweeping turns.","This layout allowed for a better transition from the Le Mans circuit to the Bugatti circuit.","This layout change would also require the track's infamous carnival to be relocated near the Porsche curves, and in 2006, the ACO redeveloped the area between the Dunlop Curve and Tertre Rouge, moving the Dunlop Chicane in even tighter to create more run-off area, while also turning the area after the Dunlop Chicane into an even larger set of fast, sweeping turns, known as the Esses en route to Tertre Rouge.","As part of the development, a new extended pit lane exit was created for the Bugatti Circuit.","This second pit exit re-enters the track just beyond the Dunlop Chicane and before the Dunlop Bridge.","Following the fatal crash of Danish driver Allan Simonsen at the 2013 race at the exit of Tertre Rouge into D338, Tertre Rouge was re-profiled again.","The radius will be moved in approximately 200m for safety reasons with new tyre barriers at the exit.","The current version of the track has been in use since 2018.","In 1988, Team WM Peugeot knew they had no chance of winning the 24-hour endurance race, but they also knew that their Welter Racing designed car had very good aerodynamics.","Thus they nicknamed their 1988 entry \"Project 400\" (aiming to be the first car to achieve a speed of 400km\/h on the famous straight), although the official team entry was named WM Secateva.","Roger Dorchy and Claude Haldi would be the drivers of car 51 while Pascal Pessiot and Jean-Daniel Raulet would drive the team's other car (#52).","The latter lasted only 22 laps, and car 51 went into the pits around 17:00 in the afternoon with engine problems.","After spending 3.5 hours in the pits, the team had the car back on the track and they decided to go for it.","The plan worked: with Roger Dorchy behind the wheel the WM P87 achieved the speed of 407km\/h (253.0mph).","The Peugeot retired shortly after that (on lap 59) with an overheating engine.","By then it had outlasted two other Group C1 entrants.","Since Peugeot had just launched its new model 405, the team agreed to advertise the new record as \"405\".","This has led to many people mistakenly stating the record as only 405km\/h, but Dorchy's best run down the Mulsanne straight was clocked at 407km\/h.","Bugatti Circuit is a permanent race track located within Circuit des 24 Heures, constructed in 1965 and named after Ettore Bugatti.","The circuit uses a part of the larger circuit and a

was a Grand Prix motor racing road course, located in Gueux, 7.5km (5 miles) west of Reims in the Champagne region of north-eastern France, established in 1926 as the second venue of the Grand Prix de la Marne.","The triangular layout of public roads formed three sectors between the villages of Thillois and Gueux over the La Garenne \/ Gueux intersection of Route nationale 31.","The circuit became known to be among the fastest of the era for its two long straights (approximately 2.2km; 1\u00bc miles in length each) allowing maximum straight-line speed, resulting in many famous slipstream battles.","Motor racing at Reims started in 1926 with the second Grand Prix de la Marne, relocating the race from the square-shaped 22km (14mi) Circuit de Beine-Nauroy east of Reims to Reims-Gueux, west of Reims.","The original 7.816km (4.857mi) circuit placed the start\/finish line on road D27, approximately 1.6km (0.99mi) east of the Gueux village center, where it would remain for the duration of the circuit.","Gradual improvements in track width to a few sections including the Garenne-Gueux \/ Thillois corners prior to the 1932 Grand Prix de France contributed to a new published circuit length of 7.826km (4.863mi) after which the circuit remained essentially the same until 1937.","Organizational changes prior to the 1938 GP de France saw extensive widening of the Thillois-Gueux straight.","The process was reported to have felled trees and demolished structures to make the circuit yet faster, concluding the Grand Prix era with the 1938-1939 championship editions of the French Grand Prix.","Racing at Reims-Gueux resumed in 1947 with the 16th Grand Prix de Reims, effectively ending the Grand Prix de la Marne series except for a last edition in 1952.","1948 and 1949 saw the first Formula 1 cars at Reims-Gueux for two non-championship rounds.","By then temporary grandstands were established fixtures at the Gueux \/ La Garenne and Thillois corners and after hosting the sixth round of the inaugural 1950 World Drivers' Championship, it became clear that the circuit needed further extensive renovations to comply with the accelerating Formula 1 technology.","For 1952, the track was re-configured to bypass Gueux via the (then) new D26 section, shortening the circuit from 7.826km (4.863mi) to 7.152km (4.444mi) after which it was renamed \"Circuit de Reims\" or commonly referred to simply as \"Reims\".","Improvements continued in preparations for 1953, the inaugural year of the 12 Hours of Reims series, which featured a new D26 track extension from the Virage de la Hovette (Annie Bousquet corner) to a new purpose built intersection with the La Garenne straight (Muizon corner) about 1.2km (0.75mi) west of the previous Gueux \/ La Garenne junction, resulting in a new preliminary circuit length of 8.372km (5.202mi).","The last major modifications were before the 1954 season, re-profiling the new Muizon corner from the previous year and the Thillois corner to a larger and faster radius, which established again a shorter and final circuit length of 8.302km (5.159mi).","This public road circuit had previously been made up entirely of

known as Riverside, RIR, or Riverside Raceway) was a motorsports race track and road course established in the Edgemont area of Riverside County, California, just east of the city limits of Riverside and 50 miles east of Los Angeles, in 1957.","In 1984, the raceway became part of the newly incorporated city of Moreno Valley.","Riverside was noted for its hot, dusty environment and for being a somewhat complicated and dangerous track for drivers.","It was also considered one of the finest tracks in the United States.","The track was in operation from September 22, 1957, to July 2, 1989, with the last race, The Budweiser 400, won by Rusty Wallace, held in 1988.","After that final race, a shortened version of the circuit was kept open for car clubs and special events until 1989.","In the beginning it was originally called The Riverside International Motor Raceway.","It was built in early 1957 by a company called West Coast Automotive Testing Corp..","The head of West Coast Auto Testing was a man by the name of Rudy Cleye, from Los Angeles, who had previously raced in Europe.","However the building of the raceway met with funding difficulties early on and a businessman by the name of John Edgar provided a much needed cash bailout.","This action prevented any halt in the track's construction.","The first weekend of scheduled races in September 1957, a California Sports Car Club event, John Lawrence of Pasadena, California, lost his life.","Lawrence, a former Cal Club member, piloting a 1500 cc Production champion, went off between Turns 5 and 6 .","With no crash barrier in place, and no rollbar on the car, Lawrence's MGA went up the sand embankment, then rolled back onto the track.","Though Lawrence survived the incident, and appeared only slightly injured, he died later at the hospital of a brain injury.","The second major event at the track, in November 1957, was a sports car race featuring some of the top drivers of the day, including Carroll Shelby, Masten Gregory and Ken Miles.","Another driver entered was an inexperienced local youngster named Dan Gurney, who had been offered the opportunity to drive a powerful but ill-handling 4.9-liter Ferrari after better-known drivers such as Shelby and Miles had rejected it.","Shelby led early but spun and fell back.","Gurney assumed the lead and led for much of the event.","Shelby, driving furiously to catch up, finally overtook Gurney late in the race and won.","Gurney's performance caught the eye of North American Ferrari importer Luigi Chinetti, who arranged for Gurney to drive a factory-supported Ferrari at Le Mans in 1958, effectively launching the Californian's European career.","Footage exists of classic races like the 1986 Los Angeles Times Grand Prix in which the Chevy Corvette of Doc Bundy, attempting a three-wide pass going into turn 1, hit the Ford Probe of Lyn St. James and the Jaguar of Chip Robinson.","St. James' car caught fire and Chip Robinson nearly cartwheeled into the crowd.","St. James survived the flames and Robinson escaped uninjured within the track bounds.","The track was known as a relatively dangerous course, with its long, downhill back straightaway and brake-destroying, relatively slow 180-degree Turn 9 at the end.","During the 1965 Motor Trend 500 NASCAR race, Indycar great A. J. Foyt suffered a brake failure at the end of the straight, shot off the road and went end-over-end through the infield at high speed.","Crash crews assumed Foyt was dead at the scene, until fellow driver Parnelli Jones noticed a twitch of movement.","Ford factory sports car driver Ken Miles was killed there in a testing accident in August 1966 when his Ford sports car prototype (known as the J-car) became aerodynamically unstable and flew out of control at the end of the back straight.","In December 1968, American Formula 5000 champion Dr. Lou Sell crashed and overturned in Turn 9 on the first lap of the Rex Mays 300 Indianapolis-style race, suffering near-fatal burns.","In January 1967, Canadian driver Billy Foster crashed at Turn 9 during a practice-session just prior to the start of qualifying for the Motor Trend 500 NASCAR race.","These accidents and others caused track management to reconfigure Turn 9, giving the turn a dogleg approach and a much wider radius (a water improvement also closed the raceway for a few months).","In January 1964, Riverside also claimed the life of 1962\u2013'63 NASCAR champion Joe Weatherly, who refused to wear a shoulder harness and wore his lap belt loosely.","Weatherly died when he lost control entering Turn 6, hitting the steel barrier almost broadside and had his head snapped out the window against the barrier.","Nevertheless, in 1983 Turn 9 was the site of the only fatality in IMSA GTP history.","In the 1983 Times Grand Prix, Rolf Stommelen's Joest-constructed Porsche 935 lost its rear wing at the Dogleg and hit two freeway-type barriers sending it into a horrific roll at Turn 9.","Of the entire road course races run at RIR, there was one that was run in a counter-clockwise direction, sometime around 1960.","In 1966 Dan Gurney tested his first Eagle racing car on a shorter, counter-clockwise version of the track tailored specifically for his car's Indianapolis-specific left-turn oiling system.","The test caused Gurney to ask track president Les Richter to hold an Indianapolis-style race there.","From 1967 to 1969 the Rex Mays 300 served as the season-ending USAC Indianapolis-car race.","ESPN was live for the June 12, 1988, Budweiser 400 race at RIR and caught racer Ruben Garcia crashing hard off turn 9 and his car went through a tire\/guardrail barrier and then goes through the fence, destroys a cement barrier before coming to rest near a fence where the fans were sitting on the 32nd lap.","He was not injured, though, and neither were the race fans, the red flag was out for 25 minutes and 5 seconds to make repairs to the area by adding 2 Jersey barriers.","After 14 years of NASCAR as a driver and later a car owner, Richard Childress won his first NASCAR race in 1983, when Ricky Rudd drove his #3 Piedmont Airlines Chevrolet to victory in the 1983 Budweiser 400k.","From 1981 until 1987, NASCAR's championship race was at Riverside.","The USAC Championship Trail also held their season ending race from 1967 to 1969.","Riverside was also home to track announcer Sandy Reed and (along with former LA Rams player Les Richter) Roy Hord Jr.","Both NASCAR team owners Roger Penske and Rick Hendrick drove a select few races at Riverside in their own cars, Penske won a Winston West race in 1963, while in the final race in 1988, Hendrick got out of the car and let Elliott Forbes-Robinson take over.","The Winston Western 500 came to be known as the signature event at the track.","Initially (1963-1981) this race was held in January as the season opener, but beginning in 1982 NASCAR elected to start the season with the Daytona 500.","From 1981-1987 the Winston Western 500 was held in November as the final race of the season.","As of 2021, 1981 is the only year in NASCAR history that Riverside held 3 Cup Series events in a single season (the season opener, the season's halfway point, and the season finale).","The reason why Riverside was the season finale for 1981 was because Ontario Motor Speedway closed after their season ended in 1980.","Riverside also hosted drag racing events, between 1961 and 1969, the Hot Rod Magazine Championship Drag Races, \"one of the most significant drag racing events\" of that era, were held at RIR.","The championship offered a US$37,000 prize, greater even than a NHRA national event prize at the time.","Carroll Shelby and Skip Barber had racing schools at Riverside to teach students on how to drive around the racetrack and show them the preferred line on how to enter and exit a corner, Barber was the last racing school to be at Riverside when it was closed in 1989.","The track was built to accommodate several different configurations, depending on the series and race length.","The three options on Riverside Raceway were the long course (3.27 miles (5.26km)), the short course (2.5 miles (4.0km)), and the NASCAR (2.62 miles (4.22km)) course.","The original racetrack had a 1.1-mile (1.8km) backstretch from 1957 to 1968.","When the track was redesigned in 1969 (it had to close for a water relocation project), turn 9 was reconfigured with a wider radius and banked with a dogleg approach added, to reduce strain on the car's brakes.","The fourth track configuration was a drag racing strip.","Before any racing event at RIR, track crews added traffic pylons to close off sections of the track.","The closed sections were determined by the specific course and cars used during any given race.","Throughout its history, various other track configurations were used to adapt the track for events such as off-road, Cal-Club and motorcycle events.","Diagram notes: The long course had the 1.1-mile (1.8km) backstretch between turns 8 & 9.","This version was used primarily for the Los Angeles Times Grand Prix, although the long course was also used for Indy car racing in the mid-1980s.","When the 1969 version was built, the dogleg was added so as to ease the transition into Turn 9 (the track had seen numerous brake failure-induced accidents approaching turn 9, and this change was made as a safety measure).","In the short course, the track would use turn 7A rather than 8.","The \"turn 7-7A\" configuration effectively shortened the back straight to just over one-half mile in length.","The NHRA drag strip ran south to north on the backstretch from the runoff to the Bosch Bridge (not shown in diagram), which crossed over the track about halfway between turns 8 & 9.","Due to its proximity to the Southern California entertainment industry, RIR was a frequent filming location for Hollywood movies, television series and commercials.","Scenes from the television shows CHiPs (used as both a stand in for Phoenix International Raceway and Riverside itself for the episode Drive, Lady, Drive), Simon and Simon, The Rockford Files, The Fall Guy, The F.B.I., Hardcastle & McCormick, Knight Rider, Quincy, M.E., and the HBO program Super Dave Osborne were shot on location at RIR.","The television movie adaptation of Gemini Man, Riding With Death, featured as an experiment on the television show Mystery Science Theater 3000, also contains footage of racing at Riverside.","RIR was extensively featured in the 1961 telefilm \"The Quick and the Dead,\" an episode of the series Route 66.","The episode stars Martin Milner and George Maharis, and guest stars Harvey Korman, Regis Toomey, and Betsy Jones-Moreland.","Milner races a 1960 powder-blue Chevrolet Corvette in the film.","Film shoots at RIR included scenes from:  Good Guys Wear Black (1978) The Betsy (1978), Fireball 500 (1966), Grand Prix (1966), The Killers (1964),  The Love Bug (1968), On the Beach (1959), Roadracers (1959), Speedway (1968), Stacey (1973), Thunder Alley (1967), Winning (1969), and Viva Las Vegas (1964).","The track was used in Sierra Entertainment's NASCAR Legends, NASCAR Heat and later was converted to NASCAR 4, NASCAR Racing 2002 Season, 2003 and rFactor.","Riverside has also been featured in Indianapolis 500: Evolution for the Xbox 360 and can be downloaded into rFactor with all 3 options.","RIR, headed by former Los Angeles Rams player Les Richter, sold the property to real estate developer Fritz Duda in 1971 after American Raceways Inc. (which also owned Texas World Speedway, Atlanta International Raceway, Michigan International Speedway and Trenton Speedway) declared bankruptcy.","Duda had once been a turn announcer for NASCAR's broadcasting arm Motor Racing Network plus the raceway's radio network (along with Ralph Lawler) and many felt racing would long be a part of the Riverside landscape.","During this time, Riverside County and the newly incorporated Moreno Valley area had a growth spurt, new residents started enclosing in on the raceway and became hostile about the raceway's noise levels, furthermore, the land the raceway was on was becoming more and more valuable that the track was almost able to survive (during this time, track president Dan Greenwood, who succeeded Richter in 1983, was trying to search for Riverside's replacement, Perris and Corona.","With protests from both residents and environmentalists, Riverside's continued existence was impossible).","1988 was the final year of professional racing for Riverside.","On June 12, 1988, NASCAR held its final Winston Cup race at RIR; the 1988 Budweiser 400 was won by Rusty Wallace (a caution flag, later red flag,  was out for Ruben Garcia when he came off Turn 9 and lost control of his car and hit a wall, barely missing the grandstands, on lap 29), later on SCORE International held its last race on August 14, 1988.","In 1989, the track was modified from turn 7 to near the dogleg after a section of the backstretch and turn 7A near the Bosh Bridge was severed for Towngate Blvd.","and Eucalyptus Ave., the modified track was called Riverside Regional Raceway and continued to be used for club events.","After 31 years of racing, Riverside closed on July 2, 1989, with the final Cal-Club event (which, ironically, ended the way it started with the death of racer Mark Verbofsky on July 1, 1989).","Duda (along with Homart Development Company) turned the \"House that Dan Gurney built\" (which had him quoting in an episode in SpeedWeek \"I'm glad to see it gone\") into a shopping mall which opened in 1992.","The Moreno Valley Mall at Towngate is on the northern end of the former raceway property and homes now occupy what was the southern end of the racetrack.","In a 1994 aerial view of RIR, the remains of Riverside's Turn 9, the original backstretch, the 1969 aligned backstretch from the kink to the entrance to Turn 9, part of the pit entrance and front stretch wall were still visible along with the Administration Building.","However, today nothing is left of RIR except for memorabilia from the racetrack.","The old Administration Building remained until 2005, when it was torn down to make way for a complex of townhouses.","Numerous streets in the neighborhood to the east of the Moreno Valley Mall off Frederick Street are named after racers that raced at Riverside, such as Yarborough Drive, Gurney Place, Donohue Court, Surtees Court, Brabham Street, Andretti Street and Penske Street.","When Riverside closed in 1989, it followed in the footsteps of Ontario Motor Speedway (in nearby Ontario), which closed in 1980, and was followed by Ascot Park in Gardena in 1991.","In the 1990s, two new circuits opened: Auto Club Speedway in nearby Fontana in 1997, and Toyota Speedway at Irwindale (now the Irwindale Event Center) in 1999 and is in danger of meeting the same fate as Riverside.","Both tracks, like Riverside, have been used for filming.","In 2003, the remainder of the old Riverside International Raceway was torn up.","The sign that was at State Route 60 and Day Street was removed to make way for both a Lowe's warehouse and a new pair of on\/off ramps and Turn 9 of the old track is now home to houses.","In 2003, plans were announced to build a 3-mile (4.8km) road course with a similar design to the famed Riverside layout in Merced, California.","The track would have been known as the Riverside Motorsports Park, but the project was abandoned in

1998, it was also used as a motor racing circuit.","Today, the AVUS forms the northern part of the Bundesautobahn 115.","The highway is located in the southwestern districts of Berlin, linking the Stadtring at the Funkturm junction in Charlottenburg with Nikolassee.","It runs through the Grunewald forest along the historic K\u00f6nigsweg road from Charlottenburg to Potsdam and the parallel Berlin-Blankenheim railway line.","While normal for a road, it is unusually shaped for a race track as it is essentially two long straights in the form of a dual carriageway, with a hairpin corner at each end.","The north curve featured a steep banking from 1937 to 1967.","While the original layout was 19km (12mi) long, the southern turn was moved several times, to shorten the track to 8.3km (5.2mi), then 8.1km (5.0mi) without the banking, 4.8km (3.0mi) and finally 2.6km (1.6mi).","In 1907 the Kaiserlicher Automobilclub (KAC) association devised a fee-financed circuit, as both a motor-sport venue and a testing track for the motor industry.","A developing company was established in 1909; however, a lack of finances and official authorisations delayed the start of construction until spring 1913.","During the Great War works discontinued, and though Russian Army prisoners were temporarily employed in AVUS's construction, the track was still unfinished.","From 1920 the remaining road work was financed by businessman and politician Hugo Stinnes.","The circuit, including a gate building and several stands, was inaugurated during the first post-war International Automobile Exhibition (IAA) with a motor race on 24 September 1921.","Afterwards the road was open to the public at a charge of ten Marks.","At the time of opening, AVUS was 19+1\u20442km (12miles) long \u2013 each straight being approximately half that length, and joined at each end by flat, large-radius curves, driven counter-clockwise.","While the Grand Prix motor racing scene still evaded German tracks, the circuit from 1922 was also the site of motorcycle races.","On 11 July 1926 the track played host to the first international German Grand Prix for sports cars, organised by the Automobilclub von Deutschland, the former KAC.","The 1921 roadway turned out to be insufficient: Already, in practice two days before, the young Italian driver Enrico Plat\u00e9 (not to be confused with the Argentinian driver and team owner of the same name) was involved in a crash that killed his mechanic.","During the race, in heavy rain, two track marshals died when Adolf Rosenberger lost control and hit the indicator board and the timekeeper's box, with a third employee succumbing to his injuries in hospital a few hours later.","The Grand Prix was won by his fellow team-member, the so-far unknown Mercedes-Benz salesman Rudolf Caracciola, from Dresden, driving a private, eight-cylinder \"Monza\" Kompressor type.","The fastest lap of 161km\/h (100mph) was set by Ferdinando Minoia in an OM.","From 1927 the German Grand Prix was relocated to the new and more secure N\u00fcrburgring circuit in the Western German Eifel range, while the AVUS received a new asphalt surface and served as an experimental track for rocket cars.","On 23 May 1928 Fritz von Opel (\"Rocket Fritz\") achieved a speed record of 238km\/h (148mph) in an Opel RAK2.","Due to the Great Depression annual auto races were not resumed until 1931, when Caracciola again won in a Mercedes-Benz SSK, succeeded by Manfred von Brauchitsch the next year after Caracciola had switched to Alfa Romeo.","The competition on 22 May 1932 saw further notable participants like the Earl Howe, Hans Stuck and Sir Malcolm Campbell.","The Czechoslovak driver, Prince George Christian of Lobkowicz, died when his Bugatti Type 54 crashed in the southern hairpin.","The following events were won by Achille Varzi (1933) and Guy Moll (1934), to the great annoyance of the new Nazi rulers, who declared the victory of German drivers and cars a matter of national pride.","They strongly backed the construction of the new Silver Arrows (Silberpfeile) generation of Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union.","In 1935 Luigi Fagioli won the race in a Mercedes-Benz W25; however, the track was no longer adequate for cars reaching average race speeds of far over 200km\/h (124mph).","In an effort to make AVUS the \"world's fastest race track\", the 1936 season was skipped and while the track hosted the cycling road race, the marathon and 50km walk athletic events of the 1936 Summer Olympics, the north curve was turned into a steeply banked turn (43\u00b0) made of bricks.","It became dubbed the wall of death, especially as it had no retaining barrier, so cars that missed the turn easily flew off it.","The Silver Arrows raced only once on the banked version, in 1937.","As the AVUS race did not count towards the championship, non-GP cars were allowed, which permitted the use of streamlined cars, similar to the cars used for high speed record attempts.","This race was run in two heats; during qualifying for the second heat, Luigi Fagioli stuck his Auto Union Type C on pole position, with a time of 4 minutes and 8.2 seconds at an average speed of 284.31km\/h (176.7mph)- which was the fastest motor racing lap in history until this time was bettered by Tony Bettenhausen in qualifying for the 1957 Race of Two Worlds at Monza.","It was also bettered by four drivers during the 1971 Indianapolis 500.","Mercedes driver Hermann Lang's average race speed of about 276km\/h (171mph) was the fastest road race in history for nearly five decades, and was not matched on a high-speed banked-circuit until the mid-1980s at the 1986 Indianapolis 500.","No major race was held after 1937 as, in early 1938, the popular German race driver Bernd Rosemeyer was killed in a land speed record attempt on a straight section of the Autobahn Frankfurt\u2013Darmstadt (present-day Bundesautobahn 5), at which point the high-speed AVUS was considered too dangerous for the fast Grand Prix race cars.","Furthermore, it was to be connected to the growing Reichsautobahn network in 1940 by extending it south towards the Berliner Ring, therefore the original hairpin at Nikolassee was demolished and replaced by a junction.","A planned banked south turn was never built; the cleared grounds in the Grunewald forest were used as a proving ground (\"Keerans Range\") by the American occupation forces after World War II.","The first AVUS race after the war was held on 1 July 1951 for Formula Two and Formula Three cars, won by East German driver Paul Greifzu.","For post-war racing, the original extremely long straights were shortened by the introduction of a new south turn roughly in the middle (just before the H\u00fcttenweg exit, where it can still be seen), reducing the track length to 8.3km (just over 5 miles).","After World War II, the Berlin Wall, with its Checkpoint Bravo at Dreilinden\/Drewitz, came no closer than about one mile (1.6km) to the former South Turn.","It is a common yet incorrect belief that the Berlin Wall cut the AVUS in half.","It was not until 19 September 1954 that this shorter track hosted a non-championship Formula One race.","This \"Grand Prix of Berlin\" was mainly a show dominated by the Mercedes-Benz W196 drivers Karl Kling (the winner) and Juan Manuel Fangio.","No serious competition was present, as many teams had refused to show up and the German Grand Prix was still held on the N\u00fcrburgring.","Finally AVUS hosted its only world championship Formula One race with the 1959 German Grand Prix on 2 August, won by Tony Brooks.","This race weekend also saw the death of French driver Jean Behra in a supporting sports car race, as his Porsche RSK flew over the top of the north turn banking, as there was no wall or fence.","German driver and journalist Richard von Frankenberg had previously walked away from a similar spectacular crash at the same site, but Behra would have no such luck as his body impacted a flagpole head-first after he was flung from his car.","After 1961, Grand Prix racing did not race on banked circuits anymore.","The banked sections at Autodromo Nazionale Monza and Autodrome de Linas-Montlh\u00e9ry  were considered dangerous by international racing standards.","They were used in connection with chicanes for some time, then abandoned.","The AVUS banking was dismantled in 1967 to give way to an expanded intersection under the Funkturm tower.","From the top of this tower, one can see that the AVUS is not perfectly straight.","The old banked circuit can be seen in the film A Dandy in Aspic (1968) featuring period racing cars.","Racing was continued with a flat north turn, but AVUS only held national touring cars DTM and Formula 3 events.","The length of the track was roughly cut in half twice in the 1980s and 1990 as racing on straights became unpopular.","Also, chicanes were added to reduce entry speed into the North Curve.","Yet, some incidents and accidents occurred.","The BMW of Dieter Quester rolled over when exiting the last corner, and crossed the finish line sliding on its roof, with sparks flying, for a podium finish.","The car of John Winter hit a barrier and exploded into a fireball in North Curve, which he survived.","In 1995, the race 2 of DTM had to be cancelled, after a multi-car pileup blocked the circuit; later that September, British driver Kieth O'dor was killed in a Super Touring Car event when his car spun and was rammed sideways, with the impact on the driver's side.","After the fall of the Berlin wall, the closure of the AVUS for race events became increasingly problematic over traffic and associated environmental concerns.","After the last races in 1998, a farewell event with veterans was held in 1999.","Since 2000, the new EuroSpeedway Lausitz in Brandenburg is considered the replacement venue for competition.","The round race control tower at the north end still remains with its prominent Mercedes-Benz and Bosch sponsorship insignia.","It is used as a (now closed) public restaurant and motel.","The old wooden grandstand is protected as a

the classic race tracks in North American sports car racing, and plays host to the 12 Hours of Sebring.","The raceway occupies a portion of Sebring Regional Airport (an active airport for private and commercial traffic that was originally built as Hendricks Army Airfield, which was a World War II training base for the United States Army Air Forces).","Sebring Raceway occupies the site of Hendricks Army Airfield (a training base for B-17 pilots in operation from 1941 to 1946).","After the war, Russian-American aeronautical engineer Alec Ulmann was seeking sites for converting military aircraft to civilian use when he discovered potential in Hendricks' runways and service roads to stage a sports car endurance race similar to the 24 Hours of Le Mans, a race Ulmann was inspired to somewhat re-create in the United States.","Sebring's first race was held on New Year's Eve of 1950, attracting thirty race cars from across North America.","The Sam Collier 6 Hour Memorial race was won by Frits Koster and Ralph Deshon in a Crosley Hot Shot that had been driven to the track by Victor Sharpe.","The first 12 Hours of Sebring was held on March 15, 1952, shortly growing into a major international race.","In 1959, the track hosted the U.S.' first Formula One race (the successor to historic European Grand Prix motor racing), held as that year's installment of the historic United States Grand Prix competition.","However poor attendance and high costs relocated the next U.S. Grand Prix to Riverside International Raceway in southern California.","For much of Sebring's history, the track followed a 5.2-mile (8.4km) layout.","After a disastrous 1966 12 Hours with five fatalities, the track was widened in parts and also lengthened a total of 50 yards (46m) for 1967 with the removal of the Webster Turn between the hairpin and the top of the track and replacement with the faster Green Park Chicane, further down the track.","This was closer to the hairpin and allowed a flat-out run through a very fast corner to the top of the track and the runway.","This was done to move the track off the dangerous Warehouse Straight and the warehouses, hangars and airplanes flanking it; a crash during that 1966 12 Hours involving a privately entered Porsche that went into one of the warehouses (this area was off-limits to non-track personnel) and into a crowd, killing four spectators.","The circuit was changed and shortened in 1983 to allow simultaneous use of the track and one of the runways, and major changes in 1987 allowed use of another runway.","Further changes in 1991 accommodated expansion of the airport's facilities, allowing the entire track to be used without interfering with normal airport operations and bringing it close to its current configuration.","The hairpin was removed in 1997 due to a lack of run-off, and replaced with what became known as the \"safety pin\".","Gendebien Bend was also re-profiled to slow the cars' entry to the Ullman straight.","The track is currently owned by IMSA Holdings, LLC through its subsidiary Sebring International Raceway, LLC via its purchase of the Panoz MSG in September 2012.","It is currently leased by the Sebring International Raceway, LLC, which acquired the facility from Andy Evans in 1997.","The track is often recognized for its famous, high-speed \"Turn 17\", a long, bumpy, fast right hander that can make or break a car's speed down the front straight.","The corner can fit up to 3 cars wide.","Skip Barber Racing School held numerous programs at the facility, including a scholarship opportunity for young racers.","The World Endurance Championship runs a round called the 1000 Miles of Sebring, run concurrently with the famed 12 Hours.","This race was first run in 2019,

tracks: the Full Circuit, the Short Circuit, and the Club Circuit.","The course of the track itself is 3.74 miles (6.02km) long.","It is a seventeen-turn road course with long straights, several high-speed corners, and very technical slower corners.","Many of the turns and points along the track are named for the early teams and drivers.","Due to Florida's flat nature there is very little elevation change around the track and little camber on the surface, providing a challenging track for drivers, especially when it rains.","Sebring is renowned for its rough, bumpy and changing surfaces.","The course still runs on old sections of World War II-era landing fields that were constructed of concrete sections with large seams.","The transitions between sections are quite rough and often, sparks fly from the undercarriages of the cars as they traverse them.","Much of the track has intentionally been left with its original concrete runway surface.","The 12 Hours of Sebring is renowned as a race that is even harder on machinery and drivers than Le Mans, and is seen as an ideal preparation run for the famed French race.","The track surface has 3.04 miles (4.89km) of asphalt and 0.7 miles (1.1km) of concrete.","Mario Andretti, a 3-time 12 Hours winner, said that one of the hardest parts about the original Sebring track was \"finding the track to begin with.\"","There had been many accounts of drivers retiring due to accidents at night, quite simply because they got lost on the runway sections and couldn't find the track again.","Some drivers got lost even during the day, mostly because the track was poorly marked down with white lines and cones.","Sebring is most notable for hosting the 12 Hours of Sebring, sanctioned by the FIA and IMSA, as part of many major endurance racing series, including the World Sportscar Championship, Intercontinental Le Mans Cup, ALMS, and now, the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship.","This race is the second of four races in the Michelin Endurance Cup.","The track also hosts the Legends of Motorsport and Historic Sportscar Racing series, and is the winter home of the Skip Barber Racing School.","Many IndyCar, sports

to improve overtaking.","This resulted in some minor changes before 2010: the planned hairpin at turn seven was removed, and the track at turn three was widened to allow drivers to take different lines throughout the corner.","More information was released in August 2010, revealing that there were plans to make the circuit one of the most challenging for drivers, with the circuit rising fourteen metres within the first three corners alone and a banked double-apex bend on the far side of the circuit.","The track has since been praised by drivers, including Lewis Hamilton who compared it to the classic Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps.","The banked multi-apex turn 10\u201311\u201312 sequence is one of the most notable sections of the circuit.","It has been likened to the long, fast Turn 8 at Turkey's Istanbul Park circuit as it is a challenging sequence that generates high tyre loadings.","Unlike Turkey's Turn 8, it tightens on exit and is a clockwise right-hander.","Although it is not one of the main overtaking points, it is the corner that shows F1 cars to their full cornering potential.","The circuit's main straight, at 1.06km (1,159.2yd), is among the longest in F1, with a key overtaking point at its end.","The pitlane is also one of the longest in F1, at more than 600 metres: as in most races with pit stops, time spent in the pitlane is an important factor in determining race strategies.","Before the opening weekend, the expected lap time for a Formula One car around the track was 1 minute, 27.02 seconds, at an average speed of 210.03km\/h (131mph).","At the end of the long straight between corners 3 and 4, Formula One cars were expected to reach a top speed of about 318km\/h (198mph).","In the inaugural qualifying session, Sebastian Vettel turned in a lap time of 1 minute, 24.178 seconds, beating the predicted lap times from tyre manufacturer Pirelli.","Scuderia Toro Rosso driver Jaime Alguersuari posted the top speed through the speed trap,

(5.514km) motor racing track and facilities located within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of Austin, Texas.","The facility is home to the Formula One United States Grand Prix, the Texas Grand Prix, and the Motorcycle Grand Prix of the Americas, a round of the FIM Road Racing World Championship.","It previously hosted the Australian V8 Supercars, the Americas Rallycross Championship, the American Le Mans Series, the Rolex Sports Car Series, the FIA World Endurance Championship, the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship both hosted the Lone Star Le Mans and the IndyCar Classic.","NASCAR began racing at the circuit in 2021.","The circuit and Grand Prix were first proposed in the middle of 2010.","The circuit was the first in the United States to be purpose-built for Formula One.","The layout was conceived by promoter Tavo Hellmund and 1993 Motorcycle World Champion Kevin Schwantz with the assistance of German architect and circuit designer Hermann Tilke, who has also designed the Sepang, Shanghai, Yas Marina, Istanbul, Bahrain, Yeongam, and Buddh circuits, as well as the reprofiling of the Hockenheimring and Fuji Speedway.","In a news conference on July 27, 2010, Tavo Hellmund announced plans to build the track on about 890 acres (3.6km) of undeveloped land in southeastern Travis County.","The majority of the site had been planned to be developed into a residential subdivision called \"Wandering Creek\".","In the same news conference, Hellmund also revealed that Texas billionaire Red McCombs was the project's largest investor.","McCombs wished to call the site \"Speed City\", but the owners originally anticipated selling the naming rights to various parts of the facility for $7million.","On April 12, 2011, the track's name was announced as \"Circuit of the Americas\" at a press conference.","The circuit homologation design was submitted to the FIA in Geneva for approval on December 17, 2010.","HKS, Inc. and Tilke Engineers & Architects designed the track, and Austin Commercial, a subsidiary of Austin Industries, was the general contractor.","Construction began on December 31, 2010, and was due to be complete by June 2012.","Following a stop-work order in December 2011, the completion date was revised to August.","The first tasks were building the silt fences, taking core samples, and shredding existing vegetation.","On January 21, 2011, a $900,000 check was posted with Travis County that permitted grading to begin.","The money was to be used to restore the land if the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) declined to allow the project to move forward because part of the site lies in a floodplain.","FEMA issued a letter on June 28, 2011, stating the project meets its floodplain management criteria.","In January 2012, Travis County announced that Elroy Road\u2014one of the two primary public access roads to the circuit\u2014would receive an upgrade to handle the volume of incoming traffic, but not before the running of the 2012 race.","At the time of the announcement, the unstable clay soils under the road surface had caused Elroy Road to gradually buckle and shift, necessitating the upgrade.","On June 13, 2012, Charlie Whiting\u2014the FIA-appointed Race Director for Formula One\u2014declared himself satisfied with the circuit's construction, scheduling a final pre-race inspection of the circuit for September 25, sixty days before the first race, which the circuit later passed.","To ensure the demanding FIA specifications for the track were met, GPS-based 3D paving equipment was used on the asphalt paving and milling machines.","The first layer of asphalt was completed on August 3, 2012.","Construction began laying the final layer of asphalt on August 14, and was finished on September 21.","The track was officially opened on October 21, with Mario Andretti running the ceremonial first laps in a Lotus 79, the car he drove when he became the last American to win the World Drivers' Championship in 1978.","The Grand Plaza, Observation Structure, Tower Amphitheater, and Main Grandstand were designed by Austin-based architectural firm Mir\u00f3 Rivera Architects.","A crowd of 117,429 spectators watched the United States Grand Prix on November 2012 after 4 years of Formula One not hosting a Grand Prix in the United States.","On October 2021, the three-day F1 U.S. Grand Prix event drew a record number of fans.","Roughly 400,000 people attended the event, breaking F1's attendance record of 360,000 set at the  2016 Mexican Grand Prix.","Sunday's race final drew over 140,000 spectators to COTA breaking the Inaugural F1 race at COTA attendance in 2012.","This surge was due to the popularity of Formula 1: Drive to Survive in the United States and the honoring of the 2020 tickets as the 2020 United States Grand Prix was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","In order for the race to take place, the Austin city council was asked to be the sponsoring municipality for the event.","Through being a sponsor, the city could apply for money from a state fund, the Major Events Trust Fund (METF), designed to attract major sporting events to Texas that would be used to pay the Formula One race sanctioning fee.","This matter was complicated by opponents of the project who filed a lawsuit against state comptroller Susan Combs, claiming that she had promised the funding to the circuit without having been legally authorized to do so, though promoters have responded stating that all necessary guidelines had been followed.","On July 1, 2011, a state district court judge declined to enter a temporary restraining order against Combs preventing payments from the METF; nonetheless, Texas Comptroller Combs reconsidered and chose not to make the July 31 advance payment to FOMC\/Bernard Ecclestone as previously agreed for the first year's sanctioning fee.","The attorney for the project's opponents has stated that he is unsure if they will continue pursuing the lawsuit.","In June 2011, the Austin city council agreed to allow the circuit to apply to the Texas Major Events Trust Fund but withheld its full endorsement requiring the circuit to pay the financial match normally borne by the local government sponsor.","As a part of the endorsement, the sport will pay $15,000 in carbon offsets and $5 million to establish an on-site research project into environmentally friendly technologies.","In November 2011, Bernie Ecclestone expressed what he called \"minor\" doubt over the future of the United States Grand Prix in Austin after \"disagreements inside the [management] company\".","These issues were later confirmed when construction of the circuit came to a halt because of a dispute between the circuit owners, promoter Full Throttle Productions, and Formula One Management.","Promoter Tavo Hellmund admitted that his company had been in breach of its contract with Formula One Management since May 2011.","The situation further escalated when state comptroller Susan Combs described the planned Grand Prix of America as a threat to the race in Texas, and said that the first $25 million payment from the state sports fund would only be made available after the first Grand Prix at the circuit, despite having previously promised to make the funds available in time for the inaugural event.","Bernie Ecclestone later issued an ultimatum to the owners and organizers: find a solution before the December 7 meeting of the FIA World Motor Sport Council or else risk being removed from the 2012 calendar.","Ecclestone emphasized that if the Circuit of the Americas were removed from the calendar, it would not be added again at a later date.","On December 7, 2011, the World Motor Sport Council released the final calendar for the 2012 season, with the Circuit of the Americas retaining its November 18 date.","Further details revealed that the race investors, McCombs and Epstein, had reached a new arrangement with Ecclestone, with work on the circuit scheduled to resume immediately.","As a part of the arrangement, organizers paid the sanctioning fee for the 2012 race one year in advance as a show of good faith.","At the time of the circuit's reinstatement, there were no reports supporting Tavo Hellmund's continued involvement under the new contract.","On March 4, 2012, The Austin American-Statesman reported that Hellmund had launched legal proceedings against investors Bobby Epstein and Red McCombs, with Hellmund claiming that he was still a part of the management company and had not been paid since September.","Further details emerged, reporting that Hellmund was in the process of attempting to acquire Epstein's interest in the company, describing the condition of the circuit as of March 4 as \"teetering\".","Epstein responded to the lawsuit by stating that Hellmund had been found to have been in breach of contract by Formula One Management.","In June 2012, the dispute between Hellmund and Epstein was reported to have been settled out of court.","In April 2011, plans were unveiled by Tavo Hellmund of Full Throttle Productions and Kevin Schwantz of 3fourTexas for the circuit to host a round of the 2013 MotoGP World Championship, with the race to be known as the Texas Grand Prix.","The race was the brainchild of Schwantz, the circuit co-designer, who would serve as event promoter with his company, 3fourTexas.","However, following the settlement of the lawsuit between Tavo Hellmund and Bobby Epstein, Schwantz announced that he would be suing Steve Sexton.","Schwantz claimed that upon the resolution of the dispute between Hellmund and Epstein, Sexton moved to negotiate directly with MotoGP's commercial rights holder, Dorna Sports, ignoring what he claimed was an existing contract between Dorna and 3fourTexas to hold the race.","Circuit representatives denied that there was ever a contract between Schwantz and the Circuit of the Americas, and that his dispute was with Dorna Sports.","Dorna later claimed that although a contract for the race between Dorna and Schwantz had existed, the contract had been terminated in July 2012 as they believed Schwantz had failed to acquire the necessary rights from the circuit to hold the race.","Schwantz then accused Sexton and the Circuit of the Americas of \"undermining\" him, deliberately blocking his attempts to establish a race in order to have the contract terminated and allowing them to negotiate a more-favourable arrangement with Dorna.","In October 2012, Dorna Sports announced that they had come to agreeable terms with organizers of the Texas motorcycle Grand Prix, including the race on the 2013 calendar as the Motorcycle Grand Prix of the Americas, but made no mention of the dispute with Schwantz or any outcome of it.","Prior to the 2014 Motorcycle Grand Prix of the Americas, the circuit announced that COTA and Schwantz had amicably settled their legal differences and reached an agreement to collaborate to promote motorcycling racing, with Schwantz taking the role as official ambassador for COTA.","On September 4, 2018, IndyCar announced that it has reached a multi-year agreement to add the Circuit of the Americas to its calendar replacing Phoenix Raceway (then known as ISM Raceway), finalizing the IndyCar Series calendar.","After hosting an IndyCar Spring Training test session, on February 12\u201313, COTA made its debut on the IndyCar Series schedule on Sunday, March 24, serving as the second race of the 2019 campaign, with the AutoNation IndyCar Challenge (IndyCar Classic), following the March 10 season-opener at St. Petersburg, FL.","It was the first time since 2014 that two tracks in Texas would appear on the IndyCar Series calendar.","On February 11, 2020, (perhaps as a precursor of the season to come) the opening day of IndyCar Spring Training, cold temperatures and persistent showers severely limited track time for all competitors to slow installation laps and a few experimental runs on rain tires.","With improved weather, on February 12, IndyCar concluded its first open test of the season.","However, the 2020 race was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","On October 1, 2020, Indycar released the 2021 calendar with COTA dropped from the schedule unexpectedly to the surprise of many, after it was announced two years prior that they had a multi year deal in place between Indycar and COTA.","On September 30, 2020, it was announced that COTA would host a NASCAR Cup Series event for the first time on May 23, 2021.","The lower Xfinity and Camping World Truck Series were also added as support events.","On December 11, 2020, it was announced that NASCAR would run the full 3.41 mile course.","EchoPark Automotive assumed naming rights for the Cup race, which dubbed it the EchoPark Texas Grand Prix.","The Xfinity and Truck races were respectively named the Pit Boss 250 and Toyota Tundra 225 with title sponsorship from Pit Boss Grills and Toyota.","The inaugural race weekend was marred by rain, with the Truck race on Saturday being in wet conditions while the Xfinity event later in the day was drier.","The Cup race the following day, won by Chase Elliott, was shortened as the weather worsened and caused low driver visibility.","On September 15, The Athletic has reported that NASCAR will return to the circuit for the 2022 season as Speedway Motorsports, the promoter of the race picked up the renewal on the contract.","The race is scheduled to be run on March 27, 2022.","In an episode of Speed TV's Wind Tunnel program broadcast on August 22, 2010, Tavo Hellmund revealed that the circuit would be 3.4 miles (5.5km) long and would be made up of twenty turns with an elevation change of 133 feet (41m).","The final plan of the circuit was released on September 1, 2010, showing a design inspired by the European tradition of sculpting the circuit to the contours of the land.","The design draws from several European Formula One circuits, including a recreation of Silverstone's Maggotts\u2013Becketts\u2013Chapel sequence, Hockenheim's arena bends, and a replica of Istanbul's Turn Eight.","Other corners were loosely inspired by the Senna 'S' at Interlagos and the \u00d6sterreichring's Sebring-Auspuffkurve.","A feature of the circuit is a deliberate widening of corners, to encourage drivers to follow multiple racing lines.","A similar feature was used at the Buddh International Circuit in India, where the circuit widens on the approach to certain corners.","The circuit was one of only a handful on the Formula One 2012 calendar to be run counter-clockwise, the others being Marina Bay, the Korea International Circuit, Yas Marina, and Interlagos.","Because of this, the circuit contains more left-hand turns than right-hand ones, placing greater physical demands on the drivers whose bodies, particularly their necks, are more adapted to the lateral g-forces of clockwise circuits.","From the start line, the drivers climb a gradient of over 11% to the first corner\u2014the highest point of the circuit\u2014with the apex of the corner positioned on the crest of the hill.","They descend the hill to navigate a series of fast sweepers modeled on Silverstone's Maggotts\u2013Becketts\u2013Chapel complex and through a blind corner at Turn 10, taking them to the far end of the circuit and a hairpin at Turn 11.","The drivers then follow a 0.62-mile (1.00km) straight back towards the pit and paddock area before entering the final sector of the lap and weaving through a series of corners modeled on Hockenheim's stadium section.","This is followed by a downhill, multi-apex corner with limited run-off before the final two corners of the circuit, a pair of left-hand bends that return the drivers to the main straight.","The reception from drivers ahead of the inaugural race was highly positive.","Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton both praised the circuit, suggesting that it would be considerably more difficult to learn than other recent additions to the Formula One calendar.","Jenson Button described the first sector as \"spectacular\", but remarked that he felt that starting second would be better than starting first as the placement of pole position put it on a steeper incline than the rest of the grid.","Kamui Kobayashi, on the other hand, was less complimentary, claiming that he did not feel intimidated by the steep climb to the first corner as it was no different from Eau Rouge at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, and accusing the media of hyping it up without precedent.","Mark Webber was also unimpressed, stating that while he enjoyed driving the first sector of the circuit, the second and third sectors were similar to other circuits on the calendar.","Bordered by the track on three sides, the Grand Plaza is a 20 acres (0.081km) space designed by Mir\u00f3 Rivera Architects of Austin, Texas that includes a large reflecting pool, lawn, and varying landscape zones.","A promenade along the north side of the Grand Plaza hosts concessions, retail, restroom facilities, and entrances to spectator seating.","From the southeast end of the Grand Plaza, two pedestrian bridges cross over turns 16 and 3 to provide access for visitors to other areas of the circuit complex.","Circuit of the Americas features a 251 feet (77m) observation tower designed by Mir\u00f3 Rivera Architects and built by Patriot Erectors as a landmark for the venue.","The structure of the tower consists of an elevator hoist-way surrounded by a double helix staircase of 419 stairs, both of which lead to an observation platform 230 feet (70m) above ground level.","The platform provides a 360-degree panorama of the circuit, as well as views to downtown Austin, Texas.","The observation platform, which is accessible to the public for an admission fee, can accommodate up to 70 visitors and features glass railings and a partial glass floor.","In addition, a \"veil\" consisting of 18 bright red steel tubes runs nearly the full height of the tower, acting as a canopy for both the observation platform and the stage below.","The design of the observation tower was inspired by the visual imagery of sports cars and movement, and the red color was selected to mimic the streaks of lights trailing racecars at night.","On July 23, 2012, COTA announced a booking agreement with Live Nation to book major concerts at an open air amphitheater to be built at the base of the observation tower.","Designed by Mir\u00f3 Rivera Architects, the venue opened in April 2013 with a concert by Kenny Chesney.The amphitheater accommodates up to 14,000 people with 5,240 permanent reserved seats.","Another 1,700 seats can be configured on the stage-front floor or there is standing room for 2,300.","The remaining general admission spots are on a sloping grass area behind the reserved seats.","The venue was originally going to be called Tower Amphitheater, but under a deal closed in March 2013, was renamed to Austin360 Amphitheater, with naming rights sold to the entertainment\/events website associated with the Austin American-Statesman.","Beginning January 1, 2020, COTA renamed the venue the Germania Insurance Amphitheater under a seven-year deal with the Brenham, Texas based insurance company.","The primary permanent seating at Circuit of the Americas is located within the Main Grandstand, designed by Mir\u00f3 Rivera Architects.","Above-ground construction on the grandstand began in March 2012, and the \"topping out\" occurred in June 2012 with completion in time for the inaugural United States Grand Prix.","The Main Grandstand is 65 feet (20m) tall, and has a total capacity of approximately 9,000 spectators.","The seating is divided into three levels: lower level (capacity ~5400, including Loge Boxes), club level (capacity ~2900), and suite level (capacity ~750).","The majority of seating is covered by a tensile fabric canopy.","The primary structure is 500 feet (150m) long, while the lower risers extend an additional 500 feet.","The grandstand also contains concessions, restrooms, offices, and two lounge spaces located at the second and third levels.","The Velocity Lounge on the second level is approximately 7,100 square feet (660m), and contains a 36-screen video wall and the acrylic painting \"Velocity\" by Dallas-based artist Christopher Martin measuring 120 feet (37m) in length.","Both the Main Grandstand and the concessions buildings in the Grand Plaza were conceived as a modular system consisting of several components that can be arranged according to need.","The concessions, with banners and deep canopies, can be expanded with restrooms, permanent seating or suites.","Inherent to this \u201ckit-of-parts\u201d construction system is flexibility allowing the site to grow and change.","In August 2017, a new soccer-specific stadium was announced to be built between the Amphitheater and the Grand Plaza.","A professional soccer team known as Austin Bold FC began playing in the USL Championship in 2019 until 2021.","The stadium seats 5,000 people.","The

Ring","location":"Spielburg","country":"Austria","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Red_Bull_Ring","circuit_text":["The Red Bull Ring is a motorsport race track in Spielberg, Styria, Austria.","The race circuit was founded as \u00d6sterreichring (translation: Austrian Circuit) and hosted the Austrian Grand Prix for 18 consecutive years, from 1970 to 1987.","It was later shortened, rebuilt and renamed the A1-Ring (A Eins-Ring), and it hosted the Austrian Grand Prix again from 1997 to 2003.","When Formula One outgrew the circuit, a plan was drawn up to extend the layout.","Parts of the circuit, including the pits and main grandstand, were demolished, but construction work was stopped and the circuit remained unusable for several years before it was purchased by Red Bull's Dietrich Mateschitz and rebuilt.","Renamed the Red Bull Ring the track was reopened on 15 May 2011 and subsequently hosted a round of the 2011 DTM season and a round of the 2011 F2 championship.","Formula One returned to the circuit in the 2014 season, and MotoGP returned to the circuit in the 2016 season.","The Red Bull Ring also hosted a second F1 event named the Styrian Grand Prix in 2020 and 2021; and a second MotoGP event named the Styrian motorcycle Grand Prix in 2020 and 2021 after the COVID-19 Pandemic affected the schedules of both of those seasons.","Originally built in 1969 to replace the bland and bumpy Zeltweg Airfield circuit located just across the street, the \u00d6sterreichring track was situated in the Styrian mountains and it was a visually spectacular and scenic circuit.","Although narrow at 10 metres (33ft) in all places, the track was very fast, every corner was a fast sweeper and was taken in no lower than third gear in a five-speed gearbox and fourth in a six-speed gearbox.","It had noticeable changes in elevation during the course of a lap, 65 metres from lowest to highest point.","Like most fast circuits it was a hard circuit on engines but more difficult on tires, because of the speeds being so consistently high.","Many considered the \u00d6sterreichring to be dangerous, especially the Bosch Kurve, a 180-degree banked downhill right-hand corner with almost no run-off area which, by 1986 when turbos pushed Formula One engine power to upwards of 1,400bhp (1,044kW; 1,419PS) in qualifying, saw Derek Warwick speed trapped at 344km\/h (214mph) in his BMW powered Brabham BT55 on the run to the Bosch Kurve.","There were other testing corners such as Voest-Hugel, which was a flat-out 290 kilometres per hour (180mph) right-hander that eventually led to the 240 kilometres per hour (150mph) Sebring-Auspuff Kurve (this corner had many names over the years, Dr. Tiroch and Glatz Kurve were others) which was an essential corner to get right because of the long straight afterwards that led to the Bosch Kurve.","Some of the track was just road with little to no protection at all, even up to the final Austrian Grand Prix there in 1987, a race that had to be restarted twice because of two progressively more serious accidents both caused by the narrow pit straight in a similar manner to the 1985 race when the race was stopped after one lap following a start line shunt that had taken out three cars including championship leader Michele Alboreto's Ferrari and local driver Gerhard Berger's Arrows-BMW.","In practice for the 1987 race McLaren's Stefan Johansson narrowly avoided serious injury or worse when at over 240 kilometres per hour (150mph) he collided with a deer that had made its way onto the track while Johansson was cresting a blind brow before the Jochen Rindt Kurve behind the pits.","Increasing speeds were also a concern at the \u00d6sterreichring; during the final Grand Prix there in 1987 pole-sitter Nelson Piquet's time for the 5.942km (3.692mi) of 1:23.357 set an average speed record for the circuit of 256.621 kilometres per hour (159.457mph).","At the time it was second only in F1 average speed to Keke Rosberg's 258.9 kilometres per hour (160.9mph) pole lap of the Silverstone Circuit set during the 1985 British Grand Prix.","Both times were set using a turbocharged Williams-Honda.","American driver Mark Donohue died after crashing at the Vost-Hugel Kurve in 1975.","In 1976, the Vost-Hugel Kurve was tightened and made into one right hander rather than two right-handers with a small section between, and in 1977 it was slowed down and became the Hella-Licht chicane, going from the fastest to the slowest corner on the track.","It is also known that four-time World Champion Alain Prost often said that all tracks can be changed but that the \u00d6sterreichring should remain unchanged, just adding run-off areas would be fine, which eventually did happen up until the original track's final year in 1995.","The track was known for having many crashes at the start of races (especially 1.8 metres (6ft) Formula One cars at the Austrian Grand Prix) because the start\u2013finish straight was very narrow (about 9.1 metres (30ft) wide), while most start\u2013finish straights on other tracks were 18 to 24 metres (60 to 80ft)  and it did not provide enough space for cars attempting to pass others, especially cars that stalled or broke at the start.","Motorcycle rider Hans-Peter Klampfer died after a collision with another rider at the Bosch Kurve (where most fatalities happened) and 29-year-old Hannes Wustinger was also killed after a crash at the Tiroch Kurve (the part that was left out of the present circuit) at a race for the Austrian Touring car championship and this sealed the decision to build a new circuit.","Triple World Champion and long time hero of the home crowd Niki Lauda is the only Austrian driver to win his home Grand Prix.","He won the 1984 Austrian Grand Prix at the \u00d6sterreichring driving a McLaren-TAG Porsche.","Lauda went on to win his third and final championship in 1984, beating his teammate Alain Prost by the smallest margin in F1 history, only half a point.","He announced his permanent retirement from driving at the circuit before the 1985 race.","The \u00d6sterreichring's safety concerns had reached a head in the mid 1990s, and in 1995 and 1996 it was totally rebuilt, at the same site, by Hermann Tilke.","Its length was shortened from 5.942km (3.692mi) to 4.326km (2.688mi), and the fast sweeping corners were replaced by three tight right-handers, in order to create overtaking opportunities.","Its three long straights, as well as a twisty infield section, asked for a setup compromise.","As much of the construction work was paid for by the mobile phone provider A1, the track was renamed the A1-Ring.","It proceeded to host seven Formula One Austrian Grands Prix between 1997 and 2003, as well as several DTM races and the Austrian motorcycle Grand Prix in 1996 and 1997.","The grandstands and pit buildings were demolished in 2004, rendering the track unusable for any motorsport category.","In late 2004 and early 2005, there were intense discussions concerning whether the owner of the circuit, Red Bull, would find another use for the site, or return motor sports to the venue.","There was a circuit extension proposal using part of the old \u00d6sterreichring.","In January 2005, return of motor sports seemed more unlikely than ever, as Dietrich Mateschitz publicly announced that he had no intention of wasting money on a deficient circuit.","Throughout 2005 however, there was speculation of the newly founded Red Bull Racing renovating the track to use it as a test venue.","In 2006, Austrian racing driver Alexander Wurz claimed he would buy the circuit and have it renovated, but the idea never came to fruition.","By 2007, talks involving Red Bull, KTM, Volkswagen and Magna International for a neuer \u00d6sterreichring failed, after VW pulled out.","Late in 2008, Red Bull began their \u20ac70m reconstruction of the track and DTM chiefs considered a return to the circuit in 2009, and in September 2010, it was confirmed that the circuit, now known as the Red Bull Ring, would host a round of the 2011 DTM season.","The championship has visited the circuit every year since then until 2018.","In November 2010, F2 announced that Round 6 of the 2011 F2 championship would take place at the Red Bull Ring.","The circuit was reopened at a special event over the weekend of 15\u201316 May 2011, which included displays of various Red Bull sponsored teams including Red Bull Racing.","The FIA Historic Formula One Championship was invited to provide the headline race attraction with a race on each day for Formula One cars from the 3-litre period.","In December 2012, Red Bull contacted the FIA to say the track would be available to host a round of the Formula One World Championship in 2013, after a slot became available following the postponement of the proposed New York metropolitan area Grand Prix of America, and by July 2013, Red Bull announced that the Austrian Grand Prix would return as a round of the Formula One World Championship in 2014.","The Austrian Grand Prix was held on 22 June 2014.","From 2014 until 2016, the track also hosted a round of the Red Bull Air Race World Championship.","On 11 February 2016, it was announced that MotoGP would return to the circuit in 2016 for the first time since 1997.","On 30 June 2019, in honour of the late 3-time Formula One World Champion Niki Lauda, the first turn of the track was  renamed the \"Niki Lauda Curve\".","On 30 May 2020, it was reported  that the Austrian government had given permission for two Formula One races to be held on 5 and 12 July 2020 respectively to kick off the 2020 Formula One season after its start had been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.","On 2 June 2020, Formula One confirmed the Red Bull Ring would hold back to back races on 5 and 12 July to start the 2020 season, with the second race styled as a one-off Styrian Grand Prix.","It would also hold the first four races of the 2020 FIA Formula 2 Championship and the 2020 FIA Formula 3 Championship.","This made it the first European circuit to host the opening round of a Formula One season  since the Circuit de Monaco did this in the 1966 season as well as the first time Austria hosted the opening race of the World Championship and therefore the first time the circuit hosted the opening round - an honour given to 13 previous venues since the inception of the World Championship in 1950.","The circuit also hosted back to back races of the 2020 MotoGP season on 16 and 23 August, with the second race styled as a one off Styrian Grand Prix.","In the 2021 Formula One season, the Red Bull Ring hosted two races again due to the Canadian Grand Prix being cancelled and the Turkish Grand Prix being

the Grand Prix of America, a race of the FIA Formula One World Championship.","Originally intended to debut on the calendar in 2013, the race was subject to a series of postponements and delays stemming from financial difficulties, failure to obtain approval from the FIA, a lack of preparedness from organisers, and a contractual dispute.","When the inaugural 2013 race was dropped from the calendar, Formula One President and CEO Bernie Ecclestone stated that the promoters were in breach of contract and that new proposals from other parties would be welcome.","The race was repeatedly

for an appropriate venue in the New York Metropolitan Area and was chosen for its location near the Hudson River and Hudson Palisades, offering sweeping skyline views, elevation changes and access to public transportation.","The circuit, designed by German track designer Hermann Tilke, was to have run clockwise.","The start line was to be located next to the NY Waterway ferry terminal, with the

change from Port Imperial to the Palisades, some 150 feet (46 meters), would have given the circuit one of the greatest elevation changes on the calendar.","Although the circuit would have passed residential areas, residents would not have been cut off from their homes; the organizers planned to provide access to the seven affected residences.","The organizers further planned to fund the race without any public money.","In June 2012, Sebastian Vettel did a promotional test run along the proposed route, describing it as \"exceptional\" before going on to add that it would become a favorite among drivers.","Commenting on the elevation changes and turns he said he was reminded of the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps and the Circuit de Monaco.","According to Vettel, the circuit would be made up of \"quick, floating corners\", and he expected cars would reach speeds of over 200mph, with the net result being that the circuit would reward the bravest drivers.In August 2012, David Coulthard
